Examples of stylistic word clouds generated via the [stylecloud](https://github.com/minimaxir/stylecloud) Python package, with both the Python code to reproduce and code to gather the text from the original data source where applicable:

* `hello-world`: A simple example to demo the base functionality of stylecloud (also lightly adapted in its README).
* `twitter`: A stylecloud generated from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) data, obtained via `twint`.
* `reddit`: A stylecloud generated from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) data in [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/), aggregated into a CSV.
* `fa-pro`: Examples using Font Awesome Pro.
