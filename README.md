Examples of stylistic word clouds generated via the [stylecloud](https://github.com/minimaxir/stylecloud) Python package, with both the Python code to reproduce and code to gather the text from the original data source where applicable:

* `hello-world`: A simple example to demo the base functionality of stylecloud (also seen in its README).
* `twitter`: A stylecloud generated from Twitter data, obtained via `twine`.
* `reddit`: A stylecloud generated from Reddit data, aggregated into a CSV.
