I'm DYING to see the speech @KamalaHarris gave tonight!!!   So many people on Twitter who were there IRL or who caught it live are RAVING about her message, delivery & clutch performance.   Please y'all let the rest of us out in the Twitterverse know where we can view it! #LJ19
Hi! Happy Friday! Twitter party?
The president who risked nothing and was too scared to be interviewed by Mueller tweets that the whistleblower who risked everything should be interviewed by his partisan allies in Congress. I'm going to go out on a limb and share that I have no respect for this Twitter bravado.
Twitter, please don’t refresh witho...   goddamn it.  Where did that twee...   son of a!   Oh there’s where I was, now I can finishing reading that arti...   What the fu....  Damnit, Jac...  STOP REFRESHI
As somebody whose been on my share of losing presidentials, I’d just like to say it’s really annoying how many twitter pundits use days like this to just gratuitously mock the loser. It’s hard, people put an insane amount of work into it, no need to be a dick, they know they lost
Twitter made anyone a Reporter.  Uber made anyone a Taxi.  Airbnb made anyone a Hotel.  Bitcoin makes anyone a Bank.
i always know if im gonna get along w someone if they use twitter everyday
twitter is just the superior social media platform
Today felt like 2009 2010 2011 twitter
Twitter will not accept any political ads? Just another way to shut down conservative voices.
Not sure about good of Twitter
I don’t try to offend, but the more people are offended by a joke, particularly on twitter, the funnier I find it. And the angrier the tweet, the more chance of me using it and turning it to laughs and cash. PC culture isn’t killing comedy. It’s driving it. As it always did 🙏
So, let me understand this: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has decided to ban political ads on his company’s site because they might contain false and misleading information. But it’s okay with Dorsey for millions of anonymous users to smear people with false information on his site?
when twitter lets us save videos it’s OVER
The two main entities attacking Twitter for its banning of political ads are: Brad Parscale/Trump campaign and Russian state television.   Hmmm.....
We’ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons…🧵
The liberal geniuses on Twitter have discovered this photo is "Photoshopped"!   It's all over for Trump now! 😂 #TheLeftCantMeme
Ok World Series twitter, what’s the best baseball movie of all time:
After a long thought process, I have decided not to do any original tweets anymore. I might, just might, retweet (not endorsement). I came to the conclusion that Twitter is no longer about its original purpose: ie to create a networked society. It is now an abusive platform.
tiktok zoomers are receiving adulation for having popularized the phrase "ok boomer" while us wretched millennials have been deploying the "shut the fuck up boomer" meme in the boomer trenches of twitter and facebook with zero praise
It amuses me to no end that those with the smallest amount of followers, are the BIGGEST TWITTER TROGLODYTES! 😂
Rita (who isn't on Twitter) who makes it so that we pay our bills on time and don't pay too many or two few taxes.  @BrandonBrungard who also produces and directs and edits, taking care of every single video that crosses his desk.
This is my favorite Twitter game:   Your rapper name is Lil + [the last snack you ate.]  Go!
Today’s Twitter was so much fun. Thanks to everyone who made this happen.
i’m literally tweeting from twitter right now – at Twitter LA
Why is Twitter refreshing itself, are you fuckin dumb bruv!??? 🤣
Question for presidential historians on Twitter - has a US president ever switched his home state during his term before?
Jack (CEO of twitter) just casually donated another 200,000 trees lol  Go Donate! -  http://www.teamtrees.org   pic.twitter.com/Fyj877dL3U
Don’t underestimate what’s happened here: Twitter has had to ban all political advertising, just to stop Donald Trump from running his lying ads. Trump is that much of a fucking liar.
Mark Zuckerberg has said he doesn't want the responsibility of blocking false political ads. If that's really the case, and not a desperate attempt to placate the far-right, Facebook should follow Twitter's lead and stop running political ads on its site altogether.
It might be a nice troll of FB, but @jack's decision to ban political advertising is a huge blow to progressives, and a boon to big-money candidates.   Twitter and FB are where candidates build and organize lists of supporters, that they then turn into donors and volunteers /1
JUST IN: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has announced that Twitter will stop accepting all political advertising on its platform.  The decision comes as Facebook faces scrutiny for its policy allowing political ads that contain falsehoods.

Morse code dot dot dashed so EDM could beep beep boop
If #MattGaetzIsATool overtakes #NationalCatDay as the #1 trending topic on twitter, it will be very, very bad.
Trump asks on Twitter, "Why are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call." There is an implication in that tweet that the president doesn't know his own Ukraine expert on the White House National Security Council.
My Twitter feed is full today of people falsely asserting that #Hinduism and #Hindutva are the same. They are not.  In addition to being incorrect, it is offensive to many people -- Hindus and non-Hindus -- to reduce a diverse religious tradition to a narrow political ideology.
A young comic, @bellykachman got a hundred thousand twitter followers when she bravely attacked Harvey Weinstein at a comedy event the disgraced animal attended. It is a damn shame that females still feel they have to rely on Harvey Weinstein to get ahead in this business.
St. Peter meets a man at the gates of heaven and says: "you may enter but first show us your scars. The man says he has no scars and St. Peter responds: was there nothing worth fighting for?"  A lesson for all of us - fight for something! (PS twitter posts don't count!)
Sorry but Jane Fonda did not recieve 60+ years of relentless persecution from US right-wing figures and mainstream personalities only for toothless milennials on twitter to call her activism “performative”....luv....that don’t make no cents
Half of my time on Twitter is staring at tweets with 100k retweets and wondering 'what does this mean?'
I'm beginning to suspect we didn't go into a recession in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 as previously reported by macro tourist twitter
Early in the 21st Century, THE MUSEUM OF ENGLISH RURAL LIFE advanced Museum Twitter Posting into the Viral phase — a being virtually identical to an Exmoor Horn ram — known as an Absolute Unit.  #BladeRunner
Okay activist/progressive Twitter.  Is it time to organise the mother of all national Right to Protest marches? Or do we just lie down and take this shit?
The exact opposite of twitter is your mom saying she loves you.
Just trying to think of major policy areas where review after report after review has made serious recommendations, which were not implemented. Aged care, the family court, juvenile detention - which others spring to mind, Twitter-hive?
The TPUSA vs Groyper civil war is the most entertaining thing on Twitter right now. Only way it ends is a cage match between Charlie Kirk and Nick Fuentes. Taking bets now.
Political ads are not about freedom of expression—they are about paying for reach rather than earning reach. We’re stoping political ads on Twitter. Everyone in a position to serve politcal ads should stop and have a think.
BREAKING: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey: "We’ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought."
Got to be honest, I’m cringing at everyone who normally fights big tech censorship calling for someone to be banned from twitter. The truest test of someone’s belief in free speech is if they defend that which they find most contemptible.   It’s easy to defend polite speech.
Rooting for you and pasta man
Dear @Twitter, time to fix your AI. Trolls/hate mongers/fake news peddlers are running amuck, but voices of sanity are being drowned. Something is majorly wrong.  #RestoreSanjayuvacha
Challenge: Twitter meme + musician who would record a song with that as a title
Twitter is the best place to learn how one thing is understood in so many different ways by different people.
I’m so old I can remember when I had to work hard to get over, not just air all my grievances on Twitter.
Trumpers trying to tell us there was no "Lock him up" chant tonight at the game—forgetting that decent, rational people with eyes, ears, and Internet access can't be gaslit by angry racists with anonymous Twitter handles.🤣
I want to say something about living with acute dyslexia because Twitter can be a pretty unforgiving place for people with unseen challenges.  Every day I get picked up on something I write. Mostly it’s kindly or humorous which is appreciated.   Sometimes it’s sneering or brutal
I'm requesting the help of KPOP Twitter for the greatest good of #TeamTrees  You can help change the world!
LOL!  Try typing in #WaPoDeathNotices @Twitter algorithms keep it hidden. Even the best planned algorithm doesn’t always work for @jack bias
Sometimes I close twitter to then open twitter because my brain is very large
Muting people and leaving them to fight in your mentions as you carry on with your day oblivious is Twitter’s best invention ever!
If we had Twitter back in the 1900s, what would the best hashtags trending?
spooky vibe check
Crowd sourcing:  What's the one (ONE!) thing you hate about "fantasy twitter" ?
I just found a hilarious female comic on Twitter and then liked all her tweets as if she wouldn’t notice.
As a Special Olympics Athlete   Can y’all do me a favor   Can you ask your Twitter friends to follow me     I wanna to show my love to everyone   #WeStandWithTank
Got some bad news for all the alt-right chuds spamming my Twitter feed today: 1) Kotaku is still alive and fighting; 2) I already know how to code
The language on Twitter can represent our worst instincts. My personal rule is to never tweet what I would not feel comfortable saying to the person’s face. So in that vain, @RepSeanDuffy is an idiotic #Trump apologist incapable of articulating a single intelligent thought.
Man, @KatieHill4CA current twitter feed is a better lesson in media bias then I could ever hope to accomplish in 11 years of being on Twitter. Go check it out.

King for a day? Could be fun
Uncharacteristically, especially in recent weeks where the velocity of his Twitter activity has increased, Trump is quiet this morning. I am delighting in the notion he saw and heard first-hand last night that most of the country hates him, and wants him in prison. #LockHimUp
I know all of us on Twitter live in a bit of a bubble, but seeing a stadium expressing the same vitriol towards Trump as we see here everyday is inspiring...
I like dis twitter shit😂😂😂🕺🏾🗣
Does anyone find it hilarious that the highest ranking republican on the “intelligence” committee happens to be currently trying to sue a twitter parody account cow?
Twitter is messy af. Everyday I’m in a joyous mood and then I make the mistake of checking twitter and there’s some tomfoolery going down. Drama, another cancel party, spotlighting someone’s failure, mean tweets and headlines. Petty energy.  BUT LIKE THE MEMES ARE SO GOOD. UGH.
I just told the best story that's ever been told on Twitter and people are complaining that I wrote the thread too slowly. Honestly!
First, I have carefully studied the Twitter conversations regarding Saez and Zucman’s (SZ) work. I find their critics largely convincing. Some specific issues:
Don’t take it from me, just use google and twitter search to come to the conclusion yourself. As I always say, ‘the evidence is there’.

I actually think the political ad policy by both Facebook and Twitter makes sense. Either make it unrestricted (Facebook) or don’t do it at all (Twitter).
Jack Dorsey is positioning himself and Twitter/Square as the anti-Facebook.
This is urgent now. We literally cannot trust PM & others not to break law. Or for foreign actors to exploit. Govt has failed to pass new ones as urged by literally all official bodies. Twitter has led the way, it’s imperative @Facebook & @google now follow #BanFacebookAds
1. Twitter bans political ads.  2. Twitter will decide what "political ad" means.  The second is vastly more consequential for elections than the first.
So Facebook is entering the streaming wars... what’s next? Original shows from Twitter, maybe, with every series limited to 140 characters. Thanks I’ll see myself out.
Twitter needs a Bitcoin emoji.  Retweet if you think @jack and team should make it happen!
Where are all the right wing veterans today on Twitter coming to the defense of Alexander Vindman and his years of integrity and service? Crickets. Total Hypocrites.
Me came on Twitter... me found out it #NationalChocolateDay... me drooled all over phone...
The people questioning Max Scherzer's toughness for not pitching tonight -- and there are plenty of them right here on Twitter dot com -- would literally be in a hospital bed with a morphine IV if they experienced the kind of pain that keeps pro athletes from playing.
You wrote @ me first. Expressed your bug ass love for me on Twitter many times. You’ve made sexy videos about me for the world to see. You SAID MY NAME. Now stop playin G’s. Our love is sacred. Get on over here. Grab Popeyes Chicken on way. Wings & thighs. Dark meat only babies.

Twitter just a bunch of bullies that got nothing else to do lol
Privilege is good. Those who have it should use it to their advantage. Let's not pretend that we don't want the best for ourselves always. Anyone using Twitter is at first privileged to have Internet access then privileged to have an opinion. Some like Sowore lost their privilege
Important message as we enter the next Bitcoin bull market:  - BTC is very volatile - You can lose all of your money - Only invest what is ok to lose - Twitter is not investment advice - Don't buy BTC with credit cards - Keep low time preference - Do your own research  🙏🏽🙏🏽
Writer: And then, the President's lawyer butt dials a journalist. Producer: What? This is the worst political thriller I've ever heard. Writer: ...But I haven't gotten to the part where the President complains about the iPhone swipe on Twitter. Producer: You're fired.  #ButtDial
Donald Trump's day so far:  - House Democrats win major impeachment court battle - Trump whines on Twitter about how his iPhone is designed - Yeah, his head is in the game - Rudy has #buttdial scandal - These people are idiots - Trump is going to prison - It's still only 7pm
De duas, uma: either Jair Bolsonaro has gotten himself a VPN to escape the fact that @Twitter is blocked in China - or his presidential account is in fact run by some other mystery fellow who is this morning using it to accuse Lula of ordering murder
On Twitter anyone can be the crazy drunk at the end of the bar.  #blessed
Twitter has just announced they're ending all political advertising on Twitter, basically saying democracy isn't ready for hyper-targeted, data-optimised messages that might be massively misleading.  EVERY other platform should 100% do the same.
Shout out to the actor who has just DM’d to explain how rude I am for not responding the invite she sent me on Twitter. I explained I hadn’t seen it as I had been at my aunts funeral. Her response: Well you sure have been busy promoting shows and your career since then!
You think the person on the headset is like hey guys, Twitter is melting down, might want to change it.
Okay, Twitter. I am an adamant believer that some songs should never be covered, but I just heard Crooked Fingers' version of When You Were Mine and goodness, it was lovely.  So. What are your favorite covers?
You're going to hate Twitter
Been off twitter for 4 months. Lost 30k followers fingers crossed its all the busy boys. What's been going on? Have I missed anything?
If you have Twitter and follow women, its actually so much easier to be a better man lol the blueprint is written everyday.
whY has Brock Hampton been so mean on the Twitter today ?
According to media reports, Twitter administration has blocked nearly a million tweets which voiced concerns on the plight of people of occupied Jammu & Kashmir. This is highly regrettable.
"How dare you suggest schools get more money than cops?" twitter never fails to be stupider than a can of paint. You want to pay Chicago cops more money for what? They barely solve crimes & certainly don't stop them. And they commit enough crimes to drain the coffers
The list is longer than could fit in a Twitter thread. But this is enough to make one thing clear: Democracy cannot withstand this punishing assault much longer. Shame on those who defend Trump's misdeeds to protect their political careers. At stake is the republic itself.  /11
I understand frustration on Twitter, but when politicians tell falsehoods they can’t automatically be deemed liars. Lying suggests intent. Maybe there was intent, or maybe the falsehood was accidental or the politician parroted a speech written with lies & didn’t check 🤷‍♂️
By the UCP's own figures, removing indexing for Income Support and AISH will save $10 million in 2019/20. That's 1/3 of the cost of their pointless, Twitter-trolling "war room". It's not necessary to attack vulnerable people, it's simply a cruel choice taken by the UCP #ABbudget
i love twitter
100K on Twitter Gbam! I love you guys ❤️
If you’re a producer and your biggest worry everyday is whether OTHER producers accept you for using loops and midis... you lose.   Not one artist gives a fuck. You need to get busy so you don’t care about lil shit like their opinions. Let them be on twitter mad with no placement
Twitter PR: “Historically, users with high follower counts have seen fewer ads. Recently, we’ve shifted our approach to showing ads to everyone who uses Twitter and as a result, some will notice an increase in the number of ads they’re seeing.”
I really love it here on Twitter. I learn a lot from you all and just want to say thanks for that.
I go soon leave this Twitter for Una
On the off chance any executive somewhere is searching twitter wondering if they should pick up #Lodge49, know I will subscribe to any streaming service that does. Hell, put it on a public access channel in the middle of nowhere, and I’d uproot my life and follow it there too.
Sharing Tweets in DMs is our love language. Today, for Android users, we’re making that easier.
If you want to know why women don't spend as much time on Twitter as men, feel free to read the replies to this totally innocuous tweet.
I come to twitter to 1) make jokes and 2) lose all faith in humanity.
People are now viciously attacking President Trump for praising a hero dog that helped kill Baghdadi. Honestly, if you’re one of those people, get off Twitter for a while - you’ve lost your marbles.

Think my twitter got hacked wtf 👀
With that in mind, I’m terrified for our EU teams today, so my twitter will be a POSITIVITY ONLY zone today  I’M CHIPPER I’M RELAXED I’M HAPPY  ✅ POSITIVITY ONLY ✅
I need 420k on ig to fire up ! We almost there ! Wish I could give you the link to go straight there from here. Most of my Twitter followers probably follow my ig, thanks everyone who does follow. #Pmp #IG
People like @RobBurl who actively went on tirades on twitter trying to make me out to e some bitter person...justifying my humiliating treatment in ridiculous ways...knowing full well that he is friends with some of the people involved in the electoral crimes.
Um, excuse me Twitter, but shouldn’t it be “whom to follow?”
Logged onto Twitter to see the, um, Rudy Giuliani butt news, and I really can’t believe this timeline, in both senses of the word.
Someone gonna get scolded about their own religion this weekend on twitter by someone who never even read the holy text.   I’m honestly just here to stand court side for the arguments 🎭
The story and pics of Katie Hill put me in twitter jail for a few hours yesterday. A story and pics that are all over the news.
BTS i love you guys as well huge BTS fan i’ve been very absent i’m sorry twitter :/
We need a regulatory and media incentive structure that pushes companies towards the Twitter end of the spectrum. Unfortunately, the opposite is true, which makes me afraid that Twitter’s transparency will stay unique and perhaps only last as long as Yoel is in his chair.
About to go on a 3 day lockdown from tomorrow to get the first draft of my new book done. I’m going to need your help though; if you spot me faffing around on Twitter tell me to get back to work please.. Cheers! 👍🏻#twitterpolice

just checked the official twitter feeds of @IlhanMN and @RashidaTlaib .. why no mention of the disgusting terrorist #alBaghdadi?  A man who only lived to kill those who didn't believe as he did.  One would think every member of Congress would celebrate, no?
hey twitter great news   when I arrived to get coffee today, I discovered there was a DOG COSTUME CONTEST in the parking lot so it was called Howl-oween and all these dogs were dressed up.  a real treat
Twitter is so Agro man. For the record photos with a CV is a popular euro thing and it makes it easy to identify people afterwards.. it’s not a descrimination thing I don’t care about colour gender or looks ..I’m not trying to fuck them I just want them to carry plates for me

Dear Twitter,  I’ve made it back to the US safely. I’m going to eat Chipotle, get my haircut, then absolutely destroy all the kids in the virtual battlefield who took off school today to play Modern Warfare.  It feels damn good to be back.  With Love, Uncle Jack
One thing I realized about twitter is that you have to be VERY CLEAR with what you tweet because people will read between the lines and perceive what they wish based on their own paradigms.
I think my sense of humour doesn’t work on Twitter. It doesn’t work off Twitter either but Twitter was my last shot.
At the risk of thinking out loud on twitter, maybe grappling with the fullness of the human experience means coming face to face with loss, abuse, deprivation, death.   But none of those things are the full story. There is light, fullness, beauty and hope to be wrestled with.
Appreciate all of the incredibly civil comments and pushback here! How often can that be said in a non-snarky or sarcastic way on twitter? 😃 My mind is always open and I’m always down for the debate. #yanggang
I'll say it again: The President's defenders aren't really trying to have an argument with you, or to provide you their point of view. They're aiming here on Twitter and on Facebook at the dumbest member of your family who will recite their points while ruining Thanksgiving.
its so exhausting turning twitter dark mode on everytime im in public so people think im normal
Dear Twitter,  It’s been 8 days since I last played a video game.  I’ve started to evolve as a human. I’ve dumped all my gaming knowledge into learning Japanese and have become fluent during this time  I’ve also walked 4 miles a day. I’m losing my true self  With Love, Uncle Jack
I’m vegan on Twitter too - no beef.
Twitter beefing is beneath The Champ.
It’s amazing how many non business owners on Twitter can tell those with small businesses that they could easily absorb £15 ph min wage... Without understanding that to cover it , prices have to rocket or jobs have to go..  Utterly astounding
Good news for the next president, all they have to do is act normal and stay off Twitter and they’ll look like the best president ever after this idiot.
My favorite people are those who woke twitter’ed themselves into entertainment careers and then are exposed as hacks and bad within six months

You should only get to be on Twitter a year and then you have to do nine years of community service

Mitt Romney has just reminded us why he will never be president. In an act that is drowning in a lack of self-awareness, it has been revealed that Mr. Romney has been operating a Twitter account under a pseudonym since 2011. @HeyTammyBruce @WashTimes #PierreDelecto #IWpol

friendly reminder that twitter likes to show what you are favoriting in my timeline and can see that you are in to some weird shit
Made big mistake. Answered questions from Politico abt @realDonaldTrump evangelical support for @POTUS & I said it was solid. Article said I “blasted” Syrian policy. Only comment was more than week ago on Twitter.  Was not blast & decision seems wise now. BS story-FAKE NEWS!
Someone - are you Twitter Philanthropy guy?  Me - yes
My “friends” on Wall Street love Twitter Philanthropy because we help so many people. They also love that I am talking about The Stalkers because they think they are very sick people, who have nothing to do all day that try to tear us down, and need to be outed — I agree!

Not even one MAGAt that I know in real life is on twitter.  Facebook, yes.  But not twitter.  Lotsa bots and fake trolls being created by Putin/Parscale on twitter. MAGAt demographic simply is not the twitter demographic.  MAGAts don't see Trump's tweets or know about 98% of them
How does Kashmir factor in?   In August, India shut down the internet & phone lines in Kashmir. But the censorship didn't stop there. Of the requests we analyzed, around 45% of the Twitter accounts India tired to censor were focused on Kashimr.
I'm back from my 12 hour "Twitter suspension" for tweeting that creepy pic of Rep. #KatieHill with the caption "The picture frame in the background looks crooked". I'm so dangerous......
I swear I’ve come to love Rudy. Dumb shit disappears for a few days and then pops up to confess on twitter that he was extorting Ukraine in the personal service of one donald j trump and not the US.
KNICKS TWITTER BACK aka the first level of plato's allegory of the cave
By the way, I would have made Trump’s crime even more elaborate if Twitter allowed more than 280 characters! 😉
Wow - I only have 13+ years in the Conservative party so being #expelled by twitter is novel.  However for others who are privy counsellors to do it this way is a scandal.  This is straight out of #cummings playbook and designed to try and make #queenspeech vote fail

If I’m understanding what I’m reading on Twitter right, Republicans just pulled a “pizzagate” but only in the national security room.
Lol at all these twitter SCIF experts who didn't even know what it stood for this morning, let alone ever set foot in one. Run home to mommy
We talk a lot on here about learning to take the L, but Iger needs to learn to take the W. You're Disney's CEO, my guy. You have people out here on twitter being like "Coppola and Scorcese never made a movie as good as Iron Man." You won. Chill. You're making yourself look small.
My favorite new routine is the following:  It’s mid-morning. I leave my phone inside, walk out to my backyard, and sit on a chair in the sun.  That’s it.  All of Twitter can rage and scream. The opinions of the world can flow across every screen. I’ll never know the difference.
Goooood morningggg Twitter 🤪😘
Twitter just shadowbanned my Julian Assange tweets, again.  You should know that Twitter is not on your side. If you want to read my free speech and that of many other censored voices you have to visit our Twitter profiles.  The deep state controls social media to control you.
.@TwitterIndia  again suspended a Nationalist @Chatterj1Asking account with 18K. Kindly restore it @Twitter.  All follow her new Handle @Riniti7.

HI! I’m back on Twitter. I took a break while we have been home from tour. Felt really good to just be home and appreciate the last few months.   BUT I wanna make a new video soon!   What would y’all wanna see?!
I'm not going to change my Twitter name for Halloween, but if I did it would be Joey Alison Slayers obviously.
I only added my basketball to my name last month ... I def don't think I am at the top of basketball twitter ... listen .. I was at the top of pillhead twitter ... sometimes you just want to hang with the WINNERS , you know ... ? I'm more than a drug addict
really want to help highlight the underrepresented women who cover/tweet about the NBA - especially WOC - so i’m working on a public twitter list. don’t want to forget or leave anyone out so...  🏀 PLEASE DROP SOME @ BELOW OR DM ME
oh goddammit, *BEER Twitter, not beet twitter (although, can you imagine?)
.@jack says he'd be "very sad and depressed" if he was on his deathbed and all of Twitter was just people "dunking."
Pls twitter allow edit
Idek why I have twitter anymore lol
So, I just got off the phone with Pete Buttigieg's campaign and they told me he didn't mean to suggest that Justice Kennedy is Buttigieg's model justice.  The campaign's position is... nuanced. I'm not sure that I can fairly summarize it on Twitter. Will write more at Vox.
Honest question (don’t flog me design Twitter)  Do design systems prevent creativity because they lock you in to a vibe? or do they enable creativity because they help you not rethink UI and patterns and open your brain to more options.
Question for Marriage Story twitter:  Is Adam Driver Daniel Fish?
Heard of A/B testing but not exactly sure why or how to do it?  Here is some background and ideas to get you started👇
Please invite me to the side of twitter where Ben Simmons is valued and properly appreciated as the superstar that he is.  Thank you.
I love when conservatives talk about “blue check marks” as if twitter verification denotes some kind of elite/powerful status. Bitch I make $14 an hour and haven’t been to a doctor in 5 years
Only 3 verified accounts on IG, Facebook and Twitter. I’m not on WhatsApp, Hangouts, Messenger or TikTok. You can send screenshots of fake accts to be removed to markwahlbergimposters@gmail.com and my team will take care of it. 🙏
No one's panicking about candidate ads on Twitter, for instance. Or even Google, which is also massive.
Good morning to everyone except fake twitter SCIF experts who didn’t even know what SCIF stood for until just this week
Let's start some Fantasy Football Twitter arguments this morning.  How do you pronounce FAAB?
I’ve lost my voice. I have a radio show on Saturday, a full day of training on Monday & a speech to give on Tuesday. Help me fix this Twitter.   Bonus points for anyone who can come up with a “cure” more bonkers than my mother’s: “every hour gargle with port”.
Lot of talk on twitter about Alberta needing to diversify their economy so they’re not so reliant on oil.  Take BC for example. If the price of party drugs craters, we still have money laundering, real estate speculation, and shambala ticket sales. Economic Diversity.
I am back at the office today post-vacation and between "Wayne Johnson loves debt cancellation Twitter" and "#nationals/#highered cross-over Twitter" and the fact that I somehow didn't manage to miss the accreditation/state auth final #negreg, it's clear I wasn't away long enough
... Joseph, you don’t disappoint ... the most abusive people on Twitter have less than 100 Followers & bec most likely they are BoTs ... You have 51 Followers ....
I’ve come full circle with comments today:  I’m biased against NA I’m biased against EU I’m biased against LPL/LCK I hate FNC I hate G2  I hate SPY  You got me Twitter! 🙈  What now? 🤔
Good morning twitter.  What is everyone's favorite kind of apple?  Mine is golden delicious.
My twitter account reached a little milestone today. To our nation of a billion dreamers, thanks a million!
Seriously...at least on Twitter, are Utah fans worse than Wildcat fans?
HI TWITTER FAMILY.  Go out there and RAKE YOUR DAY!!! JESUS IS LORD....🔥🔥🎉🎉❤️❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️🎉🎉
Science twitter, I need your help!! Can anyone tell me how it’s possible that this week has been fifty-three days long and it’s still only Thursday?
Facebook and Twitter actively find and announce IO campaigns, but Twitter follows up with raw data. Google and YouTube quietly find them and send them down the memory hole. Almost no other companies do anything.
Mario Draghi tells reporters he has no plans to open a Twitter account. 😥
Please do find our response on our Twitter feed. Best, The Spotlight Team
99% of people doing the guillotine the rich chat would delete Twitter and never talk to you again and eat buckets of near extinct rare seafood from their yacht if they won the lottery and you can’t convince me otherwise.
Twitter's Unwritten Rule #302: After a while, you stop caring about the typos in your tweets.
That's what e-mail & text are for.  If you have a habit of airing out business disagreements on Twitter & not tagging creatives you're probably -- say it with me -- an asshole.
Techno twitter has been quite good fun this week. Feels like we're approaching critical mass, someone major is gonna have a big old meltdown and crash the whole system out. Techno Brexit or Techno Credit Crunch style.
My programming routine:  - write some code - hit a tricky spot - go to chrome - command + t - "tw" + enter - twitter starts to load - i realize i am human scum - command + w before the page loads  It's great!

I could easily send my lawyers after you buy they are too busy making me money so let’s settle this on this same app. At least to begin with. There is a 500k bounty for anyone with information about who the handler of that account is. The twitter handle is @lerivay
Kyrie almost hit a NBA Street move that would’ve definitely broken NBA Twitter had he pulled it off
Just found out a dude I muted a year ago is still whining at me on the regular. Twitter still has its benefits.
Yu remains undefeated on Twitter.
Hello, Twitter. Teenagers are cancelled. Have a nice evening.
Dear Twitter Friends ❤️  As a Special Olympics Athletes     Special Olympics Volleyball Practice ❤️   Once I finish Volleyball practice ❤️    Am gonna sing a beautiful love song for Rayden ❤️ #standwithrayden
quitting twitter
my wife has a Twitter account but the only one she uses is her alt account ... to follow the BTS fandom
Dear Twitter Friends ❤️  As a Special Olympics Athletes     I love watching Cartoon ❤️  I love watching Scooby Doo      Fred Daphne Velma Shaggy Scooby and Tank that would be fun ❤️
We need a dog sitter for Sansa this weekend and Steve says I cannot ask on Twitter but if he doesn’t find someone one of you may get to spend the weekend at Stately Wayne Manor being cuddled by a very affectionate needy wolf in exchange for money and not going through my stuff.
Trump hires the worst people, claims they are the best, and then complains about it on Twitter when they suck like a crybaby.
Why not call them human scum again? I updated by Twitter bio.
illustrators/graphic designers of the twitter world get at me pls!!! i've got a project i need a bit of help with xx
I like to come on twitter once a year to let you guys know that I got a flu shot.
Just reminding Twitter’s armchair jurists that the lorry driver is entitled to the presumption of innocence 🙄  RIP to those people & their innocent dreams of a better life.
This task, a grueling one
I'm free agent now looking for OWL/Academy opportunities as flex dps, I feel comfortable on almost all dps heroes.  Contact me through twitter or discord-  danye#6803  I'll consider any and all offers and I'm extremely motivated 😤😤😤  Rt's and likes appreciated
Games twitter has been a bit “this new idea is imperfect so let’s burn it with fire” for the last 48 hours. Kudos as ever to those who have imperfect ideas and the nerve to share them.
David Ross follows me on Twitter.   Please reply to this tweet with all bullpen suggestions, and I will forward them accordingly. #Cubs
Day in,day out twitter’s hate vultures&self appointed preachers of ‘high societal values’ keep scanning&taking screenshots of my timeline,likes,RTs to try&attempt to link it to their sick hate agenda Keep playing your pathetic games, maybe that’s the job you’ll are left with!
Oh gosh Twitter is at it again. It's like a dude can't accidentally tweet one tastefully lit closeup of his own butthole without people losing their minds.
And then I looked off into the distance into the ocean and thought,  “Gosh, this would make a great tweet”  And that’s the kind of day it’s been, Twitter. Remember, don’t mix casual racism and alcohol; they don’t go together!
I really wish @DonaldJTrumpJr would just announce his 2024 candidacy for president already so we can officially write off his entire Twitter feed as nakedly craven *political* pandering to his dad's cult rather than just the normal sort of craven pandering
I just hit 60k on twitter and 785k on Instagram! So hi to all you new people!   I do not say it enough but thank you so much for all the support, I’m truly so so grateful. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I can tell when people know I'm losing my mind on twitter and they casually text me funny or nice things without addressing that I'm going absolutely apeshit. I see u and I love u
twitter has honestly done an awesome job with filtering and blocking or if necessary, suspending accounts. instagram is not so good. but I'm not really content anymore with just...not seeing it. I wanna see it and I want to fight this shit.
I don’t really understand what twitter is for anymore? My best guess: Politics, fast news, memes and @chrissyteigen
The replies to this tweet perfectly and hilariously exemplify Twitter.   Me: Moms are amazing.   Other people: PARENTS are amazing! DADS are amazing, too!   Me: Yes. OK. Agreed. But I’d like this post to celebrate moms. Cool?
I hope the lesson liberals take from #elxn43 is that you can win with a strong climate change policy.  I hope the lesson conservatives take is it’s going to be harder and harder to win without one.  With that, I’m taking a @twitter break. Thanks for the engagement.
"I was going to support a Green New Deal to save the planet from a climate disaster, but then I insulted someone and they blocked me on Twitter and so I bailed"  - the epitaph on humanity's gravestone
A reminder that the Everything Is Literal Twitter Word Police are made up of the same people who tried to argue that Ralph Northam talking with his own mouth about post-birth abortion didn’t at all say what he said.
Twitter is obviously suppressing #ProtectJamesYounger but keep pushing it. This case might finally be the thing that wakes people up. It’s time to resist the exploitation of children in the name of left wing gender theory.
Twitter is mostly a place for liberals to get a cathartic release by venting their frustrations about Trump every day.
I’m still not over the fact that a guy who was close to being President of the United States felt he needed a fake twitter account to feel empowered.
Twitter worked when you followed people whose tweets you wanted to see. Twitter died when they decided that you should see not what you want to see, but what they think you should want to see.
I've come to Tweet with you again
The spirit of white supremacy interplays delicately with Victimhood. White America will harm us in the form of media commentary, racist policies, and pop culture representations...   Then turn around and call black folks an angry Twitter mob when we use social media to resist.
Every conservative on Twitter should be tweeting about the James Younger case today. If you’re a conservative and you’re not using your platform to draw attention to a case like this, what the hell are you doing?   #ProtectJamesYounger
I remember someone on twitter said the joker became the joker after some kids made fun of him for eating beans in a movie theater. I was waiting for that scene the whole time. lmao. can't believe that wasn't true...
Why doesn’t @Twitter provide editing ability? So many times there are smart phone bloopers and you can’t even delete coz by the time you notice, the tweet has already reached thousands!
i forgot to wish aaron tveit a happy birthday on twitter yesterday....... who am i becoming............ has fame gotten to my head..................?
Hello, NBA Twitter, I’ve decided to post a Stat of the Day every morning this season, or until I grow tired of it. The first one, in honor of tonight’s Battle Los Angeles:  Over the last 6 seasons, the Lakers and Knicks are tied for the worst record in the NBA.
2018-19 PREDICTIONS #1 seeds: Phi, Den MVP: Freak ROY: Ja 1st, Herro 2nd Semis: LAC over Den, Phi over Mia Finals: Clips over 76ers in 6 -Boston doesn’t win 67 games -CP not traded -GSW misses playoffs -Miami is good -Bulls are fun -Letdowns: Nets/Indy -Thybulle wins Twitter
Mutual following on Twitter does not make you "friends". Being someone's friend takes a lot of real life effort.
I was asked on the radio last night, isn't it awful how some online right-wing personalities have defended Tulsi. My reply: stop sitting on Twitter and go into the real world, where the vast majority of Tulsi supporters, volunteers, and staff are Dems and Dem-leaning independents
If you got the artwork off @Vumeapp change your DP asap !!! Be the first!!! Posting on twitter x insta in a few #PartyAndBullshh #BlackLove
GOOOOOOD MORNING TWITTER! 😉
My secret Twitter account is @realDonaldTrump. I started it as a prank in 2015 and I’m sorry to say it’s gotten SUPER out of hand. Oopsie!
Twitter, please tell me that I'm not the only person that pushes a little bit while they wipe their ass after dropping a LOGGY? 🤔
Twitter is the greatest app ever ANDDDD it’s free
Twitter isn’t real life. Many of the trending topics or feuds that happen aren’t necessarily permeating the minds of every day voters who are trying to care for their families & have demanding lives. So just because it’s happening here - doesn’t mean it’s the dinner table convo.
Sadly, it’s this way on most social media teams in the mainstream. They constantly rob black twitter without actually hiring blacks people
The longer the Yankees go without a World Series, the more they appreciate ‘09. The more they appreciate ‘09, the nicer they are to me on Twitter. I’m not mad at it
What kind of pathetic weasel creates a shadow Twitter account not, as he claims, to observe the political landscape but rather to PRAISE HIMSELF? Folks, I give you our very own 2012 nominee #PierreDelecto ! Aka Mitt Romney!  Well, at least we know he still has one fan left
I hope no one finds out about my secret Twitter account. No one search for: Jacques Deliciouso.
We’re always updating our rules based on how online behaviors change. We're working on a new policy to address synthetic and manipulated media on Twitter – but first we want to hear from you.
What an EMBARRASSMENT!  Mitt Romney seriously had a fake twitter account called "Pierre Delecto"   What is he, 16 years old? What a small person.
My Finance Team tells me that I have given Well Over SEVERAL Hundred Thousand Dollars away as a result of work on Twitter! People say I've lost several hundred thousand dollars, but I view it that We've Helped a Lot of People!  Updated BIG Figures coming this Sunday! Get Excited!
I mean, can @realDonaldTrump even quote one ENTIRE sentence from the U.S. Constitution *verbatim*? He's the 1st POTUS to not have read it, right?  Even if he GOOGLED a sentence, he wouldn't be able to hold the line in his head long enough to write it accurately on Twitter.
Last week I thought this was obvious but Ahoy Twitter needs it explained as usual:   Republicans voting to impeach and remove their own President would be political suicide for the party for at least a generation
Monday thought...  Seems obvious that CNN is no longer a news organization but rather a DNC tool. You don’t even need the @Project_Veritas leaks, just look at all their on air talent Twitter feeds. They don’t even hide it. But allow me to use two specific recent examples...
Well now that we know Mitt Romney has a secret Twitter, let's keep our fingers crossed that he has a secret backbone too.
Yesterday I had a rest stop in Kansas City and the city demanded I pop out... and I ended up doin a concert in that bih... to top it off they knew every word to all the new music ..it all started from twitter . 🚌
Exit polls predict an easy BJP sweep in both Maharashtra & Haryana. Hardly surprising. There is no substantive opposition. And the Congress has become a party of, by and for twitter ! #ExitPolls
The banned Krassenstein brothers have returned to Twitter on @2Krassensteins. It's not clear whether Twitter will just ban them again.
justine is tweeting via twitter for iphone now and i didnt buy it for her. 🤔🤔🤔
Glory Osei and Muyiwa have been exposed on Nairaland since nah. I have said it before that Nairaland should be our own Twitter and even more, but Seun is sleeping on it. There is no information you need that is not on there. Even FBI traced Invictus Obi using info from Nairaland.
My own is I always tell u people not to believe Men are Scum Twitter. They make u hate men on Twitter but are   1. In a serious relationship/married 2. Waiting for men to pick up their bills 3. Explaining to men on Whatsapp that their tweet is just for attention purposes not real
Time spent on twitter should not be counted as part of “being alive.”
According to Twitter rules, Mitt Romney should be banned for his fake Pierre Delecto account...  But since he's the #NeverTrump spokespussy, he'll never be banned.
Mitt Romney has a fake twitter account because he's a whiny baby who doesnt have the guts to say what he wants to publicly... what a loser.
Me: “Sure is a quiet Sunday, not much going on today”   Twitter: Pierre Delecto
trying to imagine what it's like to have the restraint necessary to maintain an alt twitter account instead of just saying every thought i have under my real name, as i have been doing since livejournal
Can an anonymous Twitter account run for President?  Asking for a friend named Pierre.  #Delecto2020 🇺🇸
Dear Donut Twitter: it's good @NinaTurner notes that @BernieSanders has fought the good fight for decades. Thats called positive campaigning. It isnt an attack on other candidates. If you think it is, you're admitting you worry that other candidates dont have as good a record.
Turns out Mitt Romney has a secret Twitter account where he does stupid things under the name “Pierre Delecto.”  As opposed to Donald Trump, who does stupid Twitter things under the name “Donald Trump.”
Study and stop getting on Twitter
I think people on both sides of the aisle can admit that Pierre Delecto is an amazing fake twitter name.
Hey Twitter, the pub g highlights that were posted every week during the crazy hype of the game before Fortnite. what were they called? On YouTube?
NA is blessed to have so many reddit and twitter analysts willing to solve the great mystery of why NA hasn't won worlds yet
Checking in on Twitter I gather John MacArthur said something dumb or unkind (or both) about Beth Moore. I won’t bother to look it up.  Honestly, I’ve never cared what JM says about anything — women, the Holy Spirit, miracles, etc.  He’s stuck in an aging, fading fundamentalism.
Hi @JESnowden , wasn't aware we had issues, I've seen you running your dicklicker about me on Twitter without tagging me in on it & kissing AEW ass. Now that I'm informed, you have my number if you'd like to call me so I can tell you how many ways you can go fuck yourself, dick.
Less than 2k away from 300k! Do people on IG just NOT have Twitter?
Brilliant. Twitter India is trending 'Complete boycott of Muslims'. Do not treat this as just a trend, this is a sentiment being stoked by our polity and media. Also slow clap @Twitter #मुस्लिमो_का_संपूर्ण_बहिष्कार
twitter seems angry today pls take breathes before letting things get to u
Realize this, had we KNOWN what Russia was up to via twitter and that damned @facebook in 2015...if @senatemajldr hadn’t blocked @BarackObama from TELLING us what was up, I should say...we could’ve & WOULD’VE been diligent at calling out the evil BEFORE we ended up with Tang.
It’s only on Twitter that men are scum and Yoruba men are devils. In real life they are called Baby, Darling, Love and the rest.
Four good Twitter days for #TulsiGabbard...  Debate = 20k more followers   Hillary Attack = 80k more followers  Trump avoids giving nickname & calls her ‘Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard’ in his first-ever reference to her = 5k more followers in first 10 minutes  #IamTulsi #Tulsi2020
When the Tennessee football team catches up to Tennessee Twitter, this team will be a damn powerhouse.
Get off Twitter, you maniac...
Hi - Over 40 Twitter who was the first politician or political figure you heard the concept of “Universal Healthcare” from? I’m trying to see something.
Shout out to the losers sitting on twitter claiming low attendance and other nsemfoo.   You either need to get a life or start using your brain small.   Gyimie no d))so too much.   The dome is packed to the rafters.   Deal with your bitter little fingers & one cedi bundle.
I'm sorry.. #NationalPeriodDay?  Really?  @Jack -- is this what you wanted @Twitter to be?  Are we really pretending girls and women in America don't have access to menstrual products?  Really?  Stop it.
Love how Boris Johnson comes up with these plans based on the assumption that the EU27 don’t read twitter
Okay Twitter,  Do your thing.  @ the BEST Creative builders  (mainly Deathrun courses)
I just made Brazilian Twitter explode today.... what’s up Americans?
Hearing a weird objection today on twitter that HRC did not accuse @TulsiGabbard of being an “agent,” but rather being an unwitting asset. Anyone who says this is gaslighting you. “Being groomed” by Russians is saying she was an agent. It’s sinister innuendo.
October twitter is like:  "Hitler was misunderstood" - 10 angry replies  "I like candy corn" - 300 angry replies, 5 death threats, a global Candy Corn Summit, a Netflix documentary, and Joaquin Phoenix shadows me for a month to accurately portray me in a David Fincher adaptation
I forgot the golden rule of social media: Instagram is for jokes and Twitter is a humorless void. That’s on me. You hate to see it.
David Duke didn't even do anything noteworthy in the past day (not that he's ever noteworthy). Dem partisans just started screaming about him to deflect from Hillary's vile comments, and now "David Duke" is trending on Twitter. He's like a "get out of jail free" card
I’ve been a bit a MIA on twitter as I was handling Mike’s page and was finding it hard to keep up with mine. I’m back now😁
While #KamleshTiwari’s throat was being slit in broad daylight, Hindus were as usual fighting on Twitter over fun things like ‘North Indian v/s South Indian’, ‘trad v/s rayta’, ‘Kerala v/s Bengal’, and issuing certificates about whose Hinduism is more authentic! #NothingChanges
Remember when Twitter tough guys said Jeremy freaking Stephens was looking for a way out 15 seconds into a fight?
GF doesn't use Twitter but she wants you all to know that national parks are just trees, but unionized
If you would've told me that a politician went on Twitter, challenged Hillary Clinton to run yet again, claimed the election was between the 2 of them, then went on Fox to rant about it, my guess would've been Trump. Nope. Just Tulsi Gabbard doing her best impression of him. WTF?

Your favorite website could never sell $1 million of custom vodka and do a pizza taste test with Mike Francesca on the same day the boss got out of bed to come and murder interns named Kareem and Jack Mac 2 for keeping free Twitter gambling picks a secret
Twitter is an amazing app. We are just beginning to figure out it’s usage for humanity.
My wife - watching Netflix  Me - giving out cash on Twitter
I read Tulsi's Twitter rant and with a sigh thought to myself, "Oh good. Another stable genius."
Judging by the president's Twitter feed, it seems that Mitt Romney has gotten under Trump's skin again.
Overheard: I said “Jill Stein” three times in front of a mirror and Tulsi Gabbard arose to @ me hard on Twitter.
Twitter suspended (permanency unknown) my friend & #WalkAway gay Mike Harlow. All the left talks about is the right erasing LGBT voices. The left has invalidated all of my work, calling my movement “Russian born propaganda”. They delete Milo, Mike Harlow. Who’s erasing LGBT ppl??
I was suppose to give  someone I phone 11 tonight  on Twitter !! But he be like say nobody want am
Why is Tulsi Gabbard getting so frantic on Twitter?  Because her presidential bid is Russian out of time.
To answer your question ...  Yes, I am the guy who gave a lady over $10,000 over Twitter this week
Lakhs of Twitter/facebook/insta islamist accounts celebrating murder of Kamlesh Tiwari. But don't blame anyone without proof right?
Anyone else seeing an uptick in Twitter shadowbanning in the last week or so? I simply don’t see some people anymore and notice my traction seems way off, especially retweets.  Still down for that sit down you promised, @jack!
If you are a Democrat on Twitter & you don’t follow @SpeakerPelosi, then you are not doing all you can to help your team. Arm her with the ability to speak directly to a mass audience. @taylorswift13 has 84.8 MILLION FOLLOWERS.  Leader Pelosi has 3 million. It costs you nothing.
I'm so angry about the Doral corruption that I can barely see straight and I have to get up early, so I'm going to bed. But I want my last words on Twitter today to be "Elijah Cummings" in honor of a great American.  Elijah Cummings
Ok, my husband’s not on Twitter so I think I can ask you this. He had a beautiful 1973 Les Paul that got stolen in 1995, before the internet could be of any use. This is the longest of all possible shots, but if it’s out there and I could buy it back for him... (1/2)

Watching News at Ten a spectacular corrective to the anti-Brexit echo chamber on Twitter.  To apolitical voters, the main impression tonight will simply be that the PM has pulled off something “they said couldn’t be done”
I now have more Tiktok followers than Twitter followers, I’m officially a Tiktoker. Y’all mind if I *bites my lip* lipsync the audio to Step Brothers real quick?
Every candidate's online supporters are special in their own way, and the Warren supporters on here are mostly pretty cordial, but there's a part of Warren Twitter that's like "everything must be EXTREMELY good news for ELIZABETH WARREN at ALL TIMES with NO AMBIGUITY whatsoever".
Woman yesterday: Do you have any plans to get into politics?  Me: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  *deep breath*  No, I have a ten year old twitter feed.
Ant-Man stan Twitter might be my new favorite Twitter pocket
My pleasure to be back on Twitter. After I completed 4 years as DCM in Pakistan, I was appointed as Deputy Director General, Information Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs. With the new capacity, I will try my best to tell the story of China & spread the voice of China.
HELLO TWITTER DID YOU KNOW THAT MY NEW COLLAB WITH @Midnightasaurus COMES TOMORROW
I know I'm swimming against the tide here, but sideways claps and photos on Twitter bios won't cut it against people like Trump.  This #G7 thing is a brazen #emoluments violation and it's a signal that Trump and his lawless cronies don't give a damn about Dem photos.
There are so many things I’ve typed out on Twitter and not tweeted lol. Definitely the right choice most of the time 😂
Twitter Philanthropy is reaching escape velocity 🚀
Good morning it appears I am now verified on Twitter ☝️🤓 this means everything I say on Twitter is 100% verified to be TRUEi am the smartest man alive and the strongest person to ever exist have a great day
Rightwing twitter is a really sad place.
We are literally blazing a new frontier on Twitter. Do you feel it?
Remember, your Twitter following is NOT a measure of your worth as a person.   RT if you agree so lots of people will see this.   #thursdaythoughts
This is a scandal.  Right-wing commentator @bmartinovski was arrested at the Swedish airport and taken away by 6 police officers and interrogated.  Why? Because she had apparently "libeled" a left-wing activist on Twitter.  This reminds me of Stasi.
I’m quitting Twitter for a little while. It does not bring out my best self. Also I have a novel to write. See you later.
I have resisted having an Instagram account because I can only handle one social media platform at a time. However, a friend of mine says Instagram is not as angry, bitter and toxic as Twitter can be. Is it true?
Nobody comes out of the Canning Town incident well. Extinction Rebellion for targeting public transport when they should support it. The platform mob for kicking the shit out of the protester. The armchair hard men on Twitter cheering the violence. What an ugly start to the day.
Distressingly, not a single joke about the DUP ending with "but I won't do VAT" on Twitter this AM.
NYTimes reached out to me for an interview as someone Trump has retweeted several times. They are writing a column on his Twitter.  I said, "fine, submit your questions to me in writing and I will respond in writing so I have a record of exactly what I said."  Never heard back.
I haven't been on Twitter all day but did we acknowledge the fact that Messi has won three straight Golden Shoe awards while playing as a midfielder? If yes, it's worth stating again.
bout to transition to bear content / militant black twitter the rest of this shit for the birds fr
literally every video I make gets remade on twitter someone else and receives more attention. and everytime I say something I “gotta calm down”
Madame Speaker, let me say “thank you” on behalf of the American people for changing your Twitter banner photo.  That has to be the most meta picture usage in US history. ✊❤️🇺🇸
Hi! I'm doing a Twitter Q&A tomorrow at 6:45PST before my show at Hollywood Forever- send me your questions using #AskFinneas!
Jesus, now we have the President of the United States playing "I know you are but what am I" with the Speaker of the House on Twitter. He's a child. Remove him now. #25thAmendmentNow
Twitter a litany of horrors tonight. A Jewish MP leaves Labour over antisemitism. A functionally insane US president. Britain inching towards a ruinous Brexit deal.
Nancy Pelosi said today that Trump had a "meltdown," so now the president is on Twitter accusing Pelosi of having had one.
It is sad that you feel so unloved. These are issues that would be better resolved with your therapist and not on Twitter or by destroying our nation.
Surfing around some of the usual pro Trump conservative accounts on Twitter, and you’d think there’s absolutely nothing going on in Syria at this moment.
has Film Twitter ever been happy

You should spend more time reading books than reading Twitter.
Alright y'all tell me the specific debate moments I should cover. Here's what I've got: - Bernie schooling Biden - Kamala awkwardly begging Warren to support banning Trump from twitter - Tulsi calling out NYT - Yang on drug decriminalization
Who'd make best Prime Minister?  Johnson 43% (+2) Corbyn 21% (-) Not sure 32% (-2)  Leavers 73-6 for Johnson Women 38-20 Johnson 18-24 yr olds 32-29 Johnson Working class 44-17 Johnson Middle class 42-23 Johnson London 32-29 Johnson  Put that in your twitter pipe & smoke it ...
When you or your close family member receives a bomb threat from someone inspired by Trump’s hate speech on Twitter, then holler at me.  Lots of people of color speaking out about this, and there’s a reason why.
wtf is music twitter yall niggas just talk ab music?? lmaoooo  niggas b like "this is good" then the other ones like "no its not" and thats yall identity??
Bernie and Warren genuinely like and respect each other and the effort to turn them into ideological nemeses based on their most annoying Twitter supporters is myopic. Eventually one of them will happily endorse the other and the whole thing will seem dumb in hindsight.
Twitter is arguably the most important media platform on the planet and Trump abuses it to incite violence and spread lies—not sure why folks are dismissive of Kamala Harris’ demand that Twitter enforce its own rules and kick Trump off
Re: Suspending Trumps twitter account. Anyone who thinks this is small, has the privilege of not being a target. Ask Latinos in El Paso. Imagine that fear. The daily fear is the opposite of small. It’s a weight I hope no one ever has to experience. That’s why we talk about it.
#DemDebate four rankings.  1. Bernie Sanders 2. Andrew Yang 3. Elizabeth Warren 4. Beto O’Rourke 5. Joe Biden 6. Cory Booker 7. Tom Steyer 8. Amy Klobuchar 9. Julián Castro 10. Pete Buttigieg 11. Tulsi Gabbard 12. Kamala Harris - the Trump Twitter thing was embarrassing
For perspective, Democrats have spent more time talking about @realDonaldTrump’s twitter account than China. #demdebate
Trump's tweets incite violence, threaten witnesses, and obstruct justice. We can't crack down on Facebook but turn a blind eye to Twitter. Big tech companies must be held accountable for how they allow him to abuse their platforms. #DemDebate
Kamala Harris going after Elizabeth Warren on banning Trump from twitter is one of the more pathetic stunts I've seen in a debate.
3 Riot games coming soon, animated series, season 10 looks promising, 50Million twitch Views, 250k Twitter followers. MY FUCKING GOD TODAY IS GOOD
So Harris doesn't get very much talking time throughout the debate, which isn't her fault — but then she decides to take her big stand on whether Trump is violating the Twitter Terms of Service?
So CNN lets Kamala blather on around banning Trump from Twitter but @TulsiGabbard going after Warren on national security warrants a hard commercial break. Got it
Wow, Kamala Harris just said Twitter should shut down Donald Trump’s Twitter account. That’s terrifying for a major political candidate to argue. Especially for a lawyer & former AG. To her credit Elizabeth Warren refuses to join Harris. But that’s a crazy argument to make.
Twitter is never going to suspend or shut down the Twitter account of the President of the United States.   It will never, ever happen
Elizabeth Warren may not agree with Kamala Harris on banning @realDonaldTrump's Twitter account but @CNN President Jeff Zucker sure does!  “I think it’s a good segment…Not going to happen, but it’s a good talking – it’s a good segment," said Zucker.
kamala's such a cop she wants to arrest twitter
.@KamalaHarris says Donald Trump uses Twitter to obstruct justice, intimidate witnesses, and encourage white supremacy. Therefore @Twitter should delete his account.  Retweet if you agree!!!
I agree with Kamala Harris that Trump's twitter account should be shut down. Based on Twitter's own terms and conditions, the man has violated it them for years. #DemocraticDebate
The idea of banning the US President from social media is dumb and tyrannical in equal parts. Like leave him in the Oval Office with the massive power of the US Government and its communication apparatus but ban him from Twitter. Moronic populism at its worst.
Kamala wants to ban the president from Twitter. WOW. Just wow.
Kamala should adjust that "65 million" figure for Trump's Twitter as 50%+ of those following @realDonaldTrump appear to be bots
I cannot believe @KamalaHarris is pushing this suspend Donald Trump's twitter account bullshit at a presidential debate. It's so small ball. She is bigger and better than this.
Donald Trump’s twitter account came up in this debate & China did not.
Logs onto Twitter.   Sighs.   Logs out.
Promoting the special guest on twitter is one thing, but doing it on the debate stage... Could it actually be @AOC?
Twitter just full of angry horny people.
I'm happy to see how many people on Twitter have noticed how historic this night is that we just had an entire conversation about automation and how best to handle it, and candidates debated UBI on a national stage, with THREE candidates speaking positively about UBI in response.
the best thing that can happen for your career as an indie band in 2019 is if a bunch of verified music people argue about you on twitter. It’s the equivalent of beavis & butthead roasting you in the 90s or phil spector shooting you with a gun in the 60s
Over the past few days, @trtworld has been censored under the pretext of "sensitive content" and @Twitter hasn't yet explained the reason.   Does the TRUTH hurt @jack ? What about the expression of freedom that @twitter has been harping on for years?  #TwitterCensorsTRTWorld

Hey Black Twitter.  Not all of you, just the "woke™" hypocrite section:  NOW do you understand that White Supremacist America don't give a damn about the identities and academic theories you put ahead of your Blackness?  You Black first. Remember that before the cops remind you.
Good morning Twitter! Who are we sending to jail today? ❤️
just added a 🧢 to my name to show support for @AndrewYang   genius way to connect #yanggang on twitter  I highly recommend everyone at least take the time to look into Yang's proposals and understand the reasoning, his ideas could do a lot of good for the country
#VijayFansLovesSRK is trending. Twitter is definitely becoming more inclusive. Just don't mention Aji err Ajinkya Rahane.
Twitter is beautiful - now we want to point out all the ways the Lions had chances to win last night that had nothing to do with the officials, because that somehow has something to do with the incompetence of the officiating needing to be addressed? Ok...
Dear Twitter Friends     As a Special Olympics Athletes   My weight loss progress    I lost 45 pound ❤️
Guess it’s too hot on twitter to make this joke right now (One of I’ve been making for yrs). We’re all dumb sports fans that keep watching dumb games and complain about dumb refs and nothing will ever change. Lions got screwed. See everyone this weekend. I love the board
LeBron James getting dunked on by all of Twitter is the preseason game everyone got free tickets to. 👀
Let’s try a new poll!!!!   Please share this one so the right doesn’t totally own me with over a million impressions!!!!!  Should the motherfucker be impeached?   Good night Twitter
I've been wanting to #DeleteFacebook for years, but a lot of friends and family there just will not fucking leave. -_- (Partly bc there's nowhere better (= as easy to use) for them to go. Tumblr is a chaotic mess, Twitter is a different level of hell... ::sigh::)

This fact may scandalize a lot of people on Twitter: every person on Earth in the 15th century was a bigot by our standards. Every single one. No exceptions. The same can be said about pretty much everyone who ever lived anywhere in the world until a few decades ago or so.
Dear Twitter,  Who wants to know when I’ll be live next? 👀  With Love, Uncle Jack
My wife - what are you doing?  Me - giving away money to people in need on Twitter  My wife - sounds good honey
Disney+: this long twitter thread of all the content we're featuring, ordered by year, will emphasize disney's long legacy of iconic films  My brain immediately: quick decide which decade was the grimmest in terms of content, oh no, it's many of them
UPDATE: Twitter has restored the account of @CarpeDonktum
Twitter just unbanned @CarpeDonktum.
🚨 Twitter just suspended meme-mastermind @CarpeDonktum! 🚨 #FreeCarpeDonktum
Pro-Trump meme maker Carpe Donktum has been suspended from Twitter.
I’m logging off Twitter until tomorrow.   My innocent eyes almost saw the leaked trailer.  Goodnight lol
Some guy called me a Trump fan for criticizing media outrage over that Kingsman video  I responded that I don't like Trump and think his recent foreign policy moves have been hypocritical  He responds by calling me an anti vaxxer???  Twitter is a waste of time, everyone is stupid
A lot of Kenyans on Twitter and Facebook are dishonest. When McDonald Mariga was playing International football, he was cheered as a "Kenyan hero" but the moment he expressed interest in the Kibra seat, he suddenly became a "foreigner." They will do the same to #Kipchoge.
Hello Twitter. I am trying to not get distracted from other work on my desk by getting lured into writing songs every morning, which is what happened all summer. Therefore I am putting the title "Goblin Wizard in the Crawlspace of my Heart" here and washing my hands of the matter
Kudos to Disney Plus for the perfect flex of a Twitter thread confirming that it owns absolutely everything the sun touches, but remember that weird dog movie you loved once on cable, don't you want it back????
My favorite Twitter today is the tortured explanations of why the same video is A-OK when it shows Christians being murdered but the greatest atrocity in all of human history when it shows Trump fighting trademarks and meme pics.
Serwaa should have confronted him at the venue/immediately because Twitter is not bla bla but you vent here everyday, you sell here, you do everything here.   Typically turning the heat on the wrong target
It still boggles the mind that the current President of the United States wakes up and yells at his TV to the world through Twitter
3:00 AM Twitter. The fake ones are asleep, the real ones are still up thinking about Fortnite numbers.
I just wrote and deleted about 14 tweets bc ppl on Twitter are pissing me off but each time i compose something, it comes off as me looking for a fight. So I’ll stay quiet. But ppl on twitter be pissing me off
Thank you for 1million followers on twitter and all platforms. Now bring back fortnite >:(
Foreal though Twitter’s been a MADNESS today and I hope when the servers finally go live it’s really something EPIC that we all love 🙏🏻
WTF is everyone on Twitter right now?
if this gets 1000 retweets @WageWar has to take us on tour again twitter do your thing
2/  When I want my kids to do homework- I hunt them down and threaten to withhold dessert if they don’t listen. I do not express my view to twitter. Why tell us? TELL HIM
In one way I Wish we’d  Had Twitter when we were young, in Another ….. WE  WERE HAVING SO MUCH FUN WE DIDNT HAVE TIME TO TWT
Im almost at 1 million on Twitter... what the heck
All he wanted was a public apology and retraction. That's nothing compared to what he's suffered as a result of the allegation.  The twitter backlash she fears is even easy to manage. A few breast pictures here and there and no one will remember. Sigh.
Fortnite's 'The End' event will go down as the most watched gaming event in history for western audiences  4.5M+ on YouTube 1.5M+ on Twitch 1M+ on Twitter and 37 people on Mixer  just incredible
One of my favourite things about Twitter - which, let's be honest, can be a total cesspit - is every Sunday young LGBTQ people do a hashtag defiantly and proudly celebrating who they are. This week it's #LGBTQtakeover. It's pretty special 😭❤️🌈
since everyone is looking at Twitter, you should drink some water, stay hydrated
Twitter is such an important platform for opinion leaders worldwide. In Pakistan, it’s hijacked by a few hundred fake trolls. Hardly any trending topic is genuine, almost every conversation turns political, laced with abuses. Someone needs to reclaim this space for serious debate
stan twitter is crazy cause i met some of you in my meet and greets when you first discovered box dye and doc martins and now some of you are literally lawyers and teachers and doctors. like excuse me SAM how are u saving lives i just saw u cry to colors. ur doing great sweetie
"Fear God" is trending on @Twitter.
People in SA used Twitter to help save a life, yesterday.  More light, less harm.  Thank you ✨
Omg I forgot to thank my twitter loves thanks for the birthday wishes ❤️❤️🎀
I've realized recently that you can tell my state of mind by my twitter output.  When I'm in a bad place I don't tweet & I doubt my words.  When I'm okay it's suddenly so easy to share.  I can tell I'm better right now just by being able to tweet this.  Brains are weird, y'all.
.@Twitter, if the Iranian authorities ban your platform for their citizens don’t you think you should suspend the accounts of its leadership, including @khamenei_ir, @HassanRouhani & @JZarif, until the ban is lifted for all the people? You have the power to bring about +change.
Man, Georgia players’ Twitter accounts are gonna be LIT during the Playoff this year. Again.
Spent afternoon travelling with my toddler who slept in my arms. I’ve just watched a video on Twitter of a mother in northern Syria cradling her toddler, killed this afternoon. Trump & Erdogan have blood on their hands. We must act. Let’s follow Finland’s eg: ban arms exports now
Nba twitter don’t even talk about basketball no more lmao. They just say snarky shit in hopes of being retweeted by whatever stan base identities with them.  To the point where whenever you DO talk about basketball people think it’s “slander” somehow
I don’t care about the people (or bots) trolling me on Twitter. I care about those who have the power to troll American democracy.
No this is @realbillduke verified legitimate @Twitter account...take time to STUDY how @Twitter functions.
I really wish people would stop reacting to @devduttmyth on twitter. It is very clear that he is a disturbed man with zero personal life who thrives on online attention. The man needs therapy and a permanent internment in a good mental hospital.
Just looked up my two current creative idols — Phoebe Waller Bridge and Donald Glover — and realized neither of them are on Twitter or Instagram.   Not judging anyone for being on social media. I myself (obviously) am here writing this. Just found it sorta inspiring.
Twitter is simple . If you don’t vibe with someone’s tweets just block or unfollow & save your data an peace ! No need to act like a lecturer 😂
Why does @ChrisEvans support the Chinese government’s concentration camps? Chris is on Twitter every day but nothing about China? He supports them. Chris Evans is a Nazi and he can hire a high priced lawyer to me if he says otherwise. Garbage person. Nazi!
The best social media site is Twitter
5. Their Lefties are as crazy as the American ones but less funny. They’re trolling my Twitter pretty hard.
Seb Gorka told evangelical crowd at Values Voter Summit, many of them older folks, that they had to fight every day for Trump  because he delivered for them.  He ordered them all to create Twitter, Instagram accounts and post every day about how great Trump is. They applauded.
I lost 2,000 followers on twitter yesterday. Probably cos of all the nonstop tour promotion. But I sold 16,000 tour tickets so fuck it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
for those who don't know, I was banned from twitter for like two days for being too young when I made the account
His twitter name is fried chicken, and he said some weird things to me, so I told him to eat fried chicken for every meal until he dies
I believe I have fully converted to a Democrat. I no longer feel regret or guilt for my past ignorance and voting decisions. I have done plenty outside of twitter and made up for it.  My journey itself will be used as lessons learned.
My man saying that he likes to do things for women out of kindness of his heart instead of doing it bc of entitlement got beggin bitch twitter PRESSED!!! HUNNAY! CAN YOU SAY EXPOSED!
Twitter: Share an idea  Instagram: Share an esthetic   Snapchat: Share with your friends   Pinterest: Share your inspiration   TikTok: Share a performance  LinkedIn: Share your career   Facebook: Share to a group
Very sorry to see Shep Smith leave @FoxNews, but if Smith says he asked to leave the network before now, I believe him; I do not put it down to Bill Barr. The recent arrests by @SDNYnews should tell folks Bill Barr has less power than either he, or Twitter, thinks he has.
Come out on your own terms and when you do please know Gay Twitter will probably hate you for something at some point. Enjoy it! All part of the journey!!!
Rudy is trying to post a sit down he did with the Daily Caller but he can’t seem to properly work twitter. Keep an eye out for the disinformation he will be spreading
Thankyou @twitter & @Jack for the 7 day time out. Upon much reflection, I now see the error of my ways. I wish to offer my apologies & full support to the left, the DNC, & stand in solidarity w/Antifa.  Yeah. No. Fuck the left Fuck the DNC ...& Jack  GO FUCK YOURSELF  #Trump2020
Any time I open at Twitter I feel physically ill which is why I only look at it 200 times per day
Officially confirmed:@INCIndia party line  scripted by #PakISI. Congress leaders zealously promoted #GoBackModi unleashed on @Twitter by #Pappistan. First they handed over policy to foreign funded NGOs, then to #Jehadislamists. And now officially under direct control of ISI ???
Beto O'Rourke is what happens when the Pod Bros advise you to run your campaign based on what they see in their twitter feeds.
mom i’m being bullied by kids on the internet with fake twitter accounts can u pick me up they really don’t like the new album
Buhari’s wedding fully held on Twitter. And the man wasn’t even in attendance. The interesting thing about the whole wedding is that no one remembered to say, “Omojuwa is not around, reserve his food”. Everyone served their own interest. We will remember 😊 #BUSA2019
I know many big names on twitter have a fancy M denoting their number of followers. But for an old news anchor reaching 3/4 of an M is a humbling moment that I owe to all of you. I may not completely understand why you follow me. But that does not diminish my gratitude.
Maximum bonus points 👉 ARSENAL TWITTER
They used to blame Pakistan for militancy in #Kashmir, now have started blaming Pakistan for #GoBackModi trend on Twitter when Modi goes to Tamil Nadu! How will these guys survive without a Pakistan?
Blackboard is 20 years old. If Twitter is around in 20 years, let's see how this prediction holds up. And now I have to go rescue a three-month old from an extremely cute and equally uncomfortable outfit.
I sometimes do company internal ask-me-anything on Fridays. Let’s do it on Twitter today! Happy to talk about tech, ecommerce, company building, programming, hats. Send questions via hashtag #asktobi
Woke up to a ☑️!  Thanks @Twitter @verified 😊
Just my little monthly reminder: whatever you think of protestors, the point of protest is to disrupt. If you're annoyed with them, they've made their point. If you protest without bothering anyone that's just twitter isn't it?
I rather enjoy the moment when Up Really Late Twitter and Up Really Early Twitter merge.
Proposal: in any photo of Boris Johnson coming through a door, the look on his face will be that of someone who’s just hidden a body in the adjoining room. Twitter, over to you ....
Starting to believe in meme magic...  Scary how fast the Mei stencil made it from twitter to HK protests and newsclips.  We were just batting around translations for it this morning.
Thought I’d lay a trap to find out who’s telling stories about me on twitter.   Turns out it’s me.
Dear @TwitterIndia, this is unacceptable. You can't suppress the true voice of @vikasbha & bothers who are putting facts about #MurshidabadHeinousCrime. @Twitter
be tryna shoot my shot through liking pictures and twitter put that shit on the fucking tl like DEMETRIUS HARMON LIKED THIS PICTURE. re fucking lax
Report this bot to @twitter. He uses Russian terms to describe US Navy sailors. Is pushing propaganda & also posted a fake US government document.
so close to being someone who uses their twitter account to complain about companies
PS/ I say this as someone who cares about Bernie, believes in his message, has supported him in the past, and truly—and I know Twitter's a very insincere place sometimes, but I say again *truly*—thinks his voice is one that America cannot see go silent because of needless stress.
I  started to feel removed from a larger conversation.  I  am a news junkie and no amount of browsing websites or thumbing through apps can replace the real-time conversation about any given subject that twitter enables.
so I  accidentally locked myself out of Twitter for the last 13 days.   some thoughts on being off the platform..
We are a: ⚪️man ⚪️woman 🔘Twitter account  Seeking: ⚪️a man ⚪️a woman 🔘any Timothée Chalamet content
like, I bought it. tomato sauce Twitter is wild man
i’m against trump on everything, but even i have to admit i like that he has a twitter account. it’s cool that the president is a tech nerd like me 🤓

I don’t normally use Twitter to plug my commercial ventures, but I’m very excited about my soon-to-open clothing store chain, Forever 72.
“I’m not a racist; I had a weak moment.” LOL. You called your baby’s mother a “nigger lover.” Just delete your whole Twitter bro. That career you wanted from grime is officially over.
On #WorldMentalHealthDay I just want to remind you that social media is a curated reality. Everyone on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc - only show you what they want you to see. Their most perfect, most funny, most attractive version. It’s lies. Lies that hurt our mental health
Twitter tip: When you are the subject of personally abusive tweets, start by blocking the ppl who like/RT those tweets, then the sender. You’ll quickly discover you've eliminated a small group of dangerously unbalanced trolls who RT each other, and your feed dramatically improves
Last week, the #HongKong Government invoked the Emergency Regulations Ordinance to outlaw face masks, curbing our right to assembly just as Beijing’s strong-arm tactics extends to America. I encourage you to add the 😷 emoji in your Twitter name to stand with us in solidarity.
Folks, the bogus Fox News poll contacted 1,000 people.  So @JackPosobiec set up a Twitter poll to check it. Guess what?  39,000 conservatives have replied so far.  And 95% of them hate Fox News polls!
Sometimes I wonder why a complete stranger thinks that telling me, a grown-ass woman, what I should do with my Twitter account, will get me to do it.  If my content bothers you, unfollow it. No one is making you be here, my friend.
Was off @Twitter most of day as I was exploring Ajanta caves with my friends. Got back to the news of the #MurshidabadHeinousCrime. What kind of sick people would do this? The silence of the fiberals as always is deafening!
Dear Twitter Friends   As a Special Olympics Athletes    I be playing Golf today   Cheer for me ❤️
Today, it has been 10 years since I created my @Twitter account. I've been on these streets and on your screens for a decade! I'm grateful how social media has made the world smaller, connects us and has so much power for good. Thank you for having me on your timeline! 🤓🙏❤

“Bill Pulte began building a community of followers on Twitter several months ago by giving away random cash to followers, as well as directly donating funds to individuals in need. It has quickly grown into a large group of people helping each other.”
Twitter is a medium that lets you interact with:  - Scientists - Journalists - Politicians - CEOs - Sportsmen - Film celebrities - Authors - Similar minded people - Unsimilar minded people - Smart people - Idiots - Trolls  Where else can you get to meet all slices of society?
Nothing created by humans is ever perfect. All books/ideas/mentors/philosophies have biases. Take what is useful and ignore the rest. Life is too short to spend arguing. This is also true for Twitter accounts. Unfollow/Block what you don’t want.   Focus on your own goals instead.
I will be going to bed now and not because anyone on Twitter told me to but because it is the appropriate time and I am tired goodnight
Colleen was so clever saying ‘it’s.... Rebekah Vardy’s account’ instead of just saying it was Rebekah Vardy - you can just tell she’s gotten legal advice and had been planning this delicious takedown for months. I can’t stop thinking about it 😍😍😍 Best day on Twitter in ages xl
Just so you know, this is my life, every day, on twitter, in email, and on the phone: comments  from @nobody63626600 sent today: "fucking prick", "I'll slap the shit out of you", "Go fuck yourself," etc.  Life in America in 2019.
Turkish propagandists are now trolling us on twitter, defending Trump, as well as their slaughter of Kurds.  I am blocking them.
instagram is down  time to use twitter   hi everyone 👋
Hey @Twitter maybe focus less on deleting @FelloWyatt’s account coz he was under 13 when he created it and focus a lil more on monitoring people who use their accounts to spew hate speech? Just a thought...
Seriously, on Twitter you can interact with:  • CEOs • Celebrities • Journalists • Brands • Politicians • Athletes • Comedians • Authors • Musicians • Like-minded people • Unlike-minded people • Millions of people • One specific person  There’s nothing else like it
Did someone just hack my twitter? How did a pro-Trump, anti-impeachment post go up from my account. I’m changing my password, but I seriously hope that was a pocket-retweet.
If someone has their pronouns listed in their Twitter bio, you can confidently assume that nothing they have to say is worth listening to.  We call this phenomenon 'Zuby's Razor'.   It has a 100% hit rate.  Test it out.

Hi Twitter world - been a while. Figuring out a way to consolidate all the social platforms I use. Hit me back with that your favorite one is! Twitter? IG? Patreon? Facebook? Let me know!
Watching a loved one learn to really use Twitter for the first time is like watching a young deer wobble tenderly towards the world's largest trash fire.
In related news, I suggest Ellen show read up on two things:  1) Streisand effect, where you took down my video with 10K views, resulting in masses on Twitter reuploading for a collective 300K views  2) US Copyright law and Twitter policy, which makes you pay MY legal fees
Send me a video from twitter that made you say “wtf is going on”
Trump, mockingly "thank"ing Obama for "138" judicial vacancies, tells a Sir Story about how he asked how many vacancies there were and was told "138 to 142." (It was under 110.) (Trump used "142" on Twitter a little earlier today, which he appeared to belatedly remember.)
Silicon Valley has decided to go full heel. Because NOT helping to elect Trump means having to deal with a new administration that wants to hold Facebook, Twitter, and the rest of them accountable for their actions. They are willfully destroying democracy to protect themselves.
Henry K. Frese, the former intelligence employee arrested on suspicion of leaking information to journalists, has a Twitter account. He goes by the name "Kyle Frese." @HKFrese

Just to clarify for all of you partisan, obtuse Twitter warriors: @realDonaldTrump is not the bad guy. Erdogan is. He's the president of Turkey... just to save you geniuses a google search...
Dear people of Twitter,  I beg of you...please stop writing “If you agree raise your hand” posts. Stop. Stooooooooooop. You just want people to click “like” on a statement that you already know the people following you agree with.
Tucker Carlson: ‘I Can’t Think of One’ Company That’s Hurt America More Than Twitter”  I can...  _ _ _           3 letters

BREAKING: Turkey’s President Erdogan announces on twitter that military action against Kurdish forces and ISIS have begun in northern Syria. “Our mission is to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border, and to bring peace to the area.”
Countries in my Twitter feed where the word “coup” is being thrown around by politicians:  - Ecuador 🇪🇨  - Peru 🇵🇪  - Brazil 🇧🇷  - the United States 🇺🇸   Fun times in the Americas!
I’d normally never be on Twitter during Yom Kippur, but we just got word about a shooting at or near a synagogue in Halle, Germany.   Early reports: 2 people were killed. A suspect has been arrested.   On holiest day of Jewish year, Jews attacked...again.   Pray for the victims.
I have Plenty of Time today and have set it aside for Twitter engagement.   I have time to pick on a few interesting points of view from Defenders of Mediocrity today.   It is one of such rare days that I can give to them by engaging their intolerant herd mentality.    Go ahead.
Times like these are truly when Twitter is as its best.
Dropped the chicken on insta but comes to twitter to cook that beef.
I’m only dimly aware of football or Coleen Rooney, and I’d never heard the name Rebekah Vardy before ten minutes ago. Now I live for their drama. It’s been a while since we had a good Twitter live soap 🧼
Would like to thank @peaceforchange for taking action against Twitter on accounts that were suspended by Indian employees for speaking out against the genocide in Kashmir. Hope @twitter will now allow voices of the Kashmiris to be heard! #ThankYouDGISPR
#Blizzardboycott is now trending on Twitter
WWE...WWS...WWE...WWS... 😐 I learned that it's dangerous to twitter when I'm half asleep.🤐   My feelings are ready to join WWE. However, my body is not flexible and needs to be trained....
Your husband is destroying our Republic, he is throwing regular nonsensical, incendiary twitter tantrums, and he is being investigated for unprecedented criminality.  Tennis, anyone?
I never thought Twitter Philanthropy would get as big as it has. Truthfully. I just figured I would be a millennial trying to bring “charitable giving” into the 21st century. Turns out technology can be used to help so many more people.
I founded Twitter Philanthropy with the 100% intention of helping other people. I truly do not care about news articles, follower counts, or otherwise. Truly. I want to create as big of a community of giving as possible. That is all. Help. Other. People.
People get in trouble on twitter when they think their tweets have impact.  Your/my tweets aren’t altering shit. This platform is 99 percent projecting, preening, validation seeking, self preservation. I tweet for one reason. 💰My peeps sell this nonsense and daddy gets new kicks
Instagram night mode is better than twitter night mode .. FACTS
Even though so many of you are dicks on twitter I still wish the best for you, even Jorge Masvidal.  Bitterness is an exercise in futility
Twitter is the people who are mad at Ellen for being friends with George Bush and Facebook is the people who are mad at George Bush for being friends with Ellen
Dear Twitter users:  this is a virtual handshake.    I will remember & excoriate each and every one of you who don’t accept.
And let’s be frank: it’s time for Trump to stop using Twitter to play into our adversaries’ hands. With every deranged tweet, he advances foreign interests by dividing Americans. Social media companies must account for the role they play in amplifying Trump's dangerous rhetoric.
Advice for Pres Trump, Pres Carter says, "My advice to him would be to tell the truth & also to cut back on his Twitter feeds. And give the House of Reps & also the Senate, and the general public the evidence that we need to form a case either for or against him." #AMRstaff
Tonight begins Yom Kippur and I will be off of twitter through tomorrow.   My goal for the year ahead is to try and be kinder and more tolerant.   Like many of us on twitter, I fail at this quite often.   If you’re celebrating, may you be inscribed in the book of life.   ❤️
I love that I got knicks and nets Twitter in a frenzy, make sure y’all come to the games and bring it full circle. I don’t wanna hear no bullshit
Prime Minister Imran Khan has become the sixth most popular world leader on Twitter, boasting 10.5 million followers on the micro-blogging platform  #ARYNews #PMImranKhan
Updated iPhone overnight.  Twitter changed colors.  Blue check marks aren’t blue anymore.  Unsure who is a real person now.
The saddest Twitter is people in Turkey or Hong Kong try to interpret presidential tweets as part of a coherent framework representing some sort of long-term strategy. There's so much at stake, but nobody believes it's who talked to him last or what was just on Fox and Friends.
Dear Twitter Friends     As a Special Olympics Athletes   My Weight loss progress       I lost 43 Pound ❤️
2nite is the season 6 premiere of @CW_TheFlash ! Can't wait 4 you all to 2 it. I'm working but am going 2 b with you guys on twitter during the 8pm east coast viewing. I won't be able to watch the episode but will try to answer any questions you might have! #theflash #bloodwork
Incredibly, the hashtag #PioliOut is now trending worldwide on Twitter. Stefano Pioli hasn't even signed his contract with Milan yet.
TWITTER can mean:  Towards Writing Interesting Thoughts To Engage Readers                                              OR  Towards Writing Insulting Thoughts To Enrage Readers  YOUR CHOICE
Just hit 700,000 followers on Twitter! ⚡️ CUPCAKES PEPPER DEM! #TeamCuppy
On October 26 I will be completing 5 years on twitter..   It’s time for me to think what will I do for the next 5 years here.. Genuinely thinking of starting a series to explain economics to the commoners in a language which you and I understand.  I don’t know how it will work
I left Twitter to get some work done but I just read the Ellen story. I don’t know if writers have said this but Ellen is one of the most reprehensible people to work for in Hollywood. The stories of abusive behavior toward her writing staff are amazing. A horrific person.
This is how the New York Times evening briefing email described the president's unhinged, batshit crazy "obliterate"/"unmatched wisdom" tweet:   "Mr. Trump returned to Twitter to say he would restrain Turkey."  #normalization
Hey art twitter! What's your favourite piece of art you've made this year, so far? It could be a quick sketch, a finished painting, or anything in between - share something you're proud of! 💕
I wonder if Twitter shut down tomorrow if we'd all just continue it by yelling our opinions at strangers in person
Twitter Philanthropy allows me as a "wealthy" person to find someone in immediate need or crisis, and send them money instantly.  Problem solved. Boom.
About to get on stage, so I'm handing my Twitter account off to my team again. Here we go! #leadersdebate2019 #elxn43 #cdnpoli
Logan Paul came out as pro-life. He's upset that babies are killed during abortions, as any sane person ought to be. In response, Twitter's leftists are very upset. #loganpaulisoverparty

Haven’t changed my name on Twitter since 2010... but bitch.... it’s in the name of making history #STREAMTRUTHHURTS
Remember... when POTUS throws rants & makes impulsive foreign policy decisions on Twitter, he’s actually distracting us from the ongoing impeachment inquiry. His tactics are predictable. Under threat he doubles down & creates chaos. Do not let him cloud the larger picture.
I honestly think it would be better if America had a better president than an illiterate lying Twitter troll.
Honestly top players should unionize but it won't realistically happen. If TOs aren't willing to work with top players you will see more people attend less and less as soon as their stream/twitter grows big enough. With how awful schedules and payouts are - who can blame them?
I notice today, on this historic moment of American betrayal and horror, Republicans all over twitter - including my senator @JohnCornyn - are breaking out tweets about and photos of Hillary Clinton, a private citizen who has not been in government for 6 years. Their only go-to.
Tweetdeck, owned by twitter, shows I have 29 replies to a tweet.  I open the tweet and I see only 8 replies, 100% of which are trolls.  Could it be that Twitter is allowing me to see only troll replies to my tweets so I cannot engage with supporters?  Only 8 out of 29?  Yessir.
I love getting texts from @Zelina_VegaWWE we are talking about YOU twitter and how you can’t take a damn joke 😂😂😂
Okay help me here Twitter: So Pat Robertson, Sen. Lindsay Graham, #MoscowMitch et al. are appalled at the #Kurd betrayal by Trump but they are okay with #pornstar payments, #migrant kids in cages, adultery, racism, sexual assault, #Ukraine #China #ElectionInterference
1. We shouldn’t have any U.S. forces in Syria without congressional approval.  2. We shouldn’t tell Turkey it’s okay to invade Syria.  President Trump is keeping troops in Syria; just moving some. And despite Trump’s Twitter warnings, Turkey would not invade without his go-ahead.
That Lahav Harkov tweet is both a libel against me and - some might argue - an incitement of violence against me (as she is ludicrously suggesting I am behind violent neo-Nazi attacks!) Do feel free to join me in reporting her tweet to @Twitter and @TwitterSupport
Between the near-universal revulsion at the NBA’s abject cowardice and the bipartisan condemnation of Trump’s horrific betrayal of an ally, this might be the most unified day on Twitter I’ve ever seen.
The only twitter accounts defending Trump now are fake troll bots and blue check marks who sold their souls to Trump/Putin and now depend on Trump/Putin for survival.  They are traitors.
i rarely read the president’s twitter feed so it was genuinely disorienting for me to just scroll through the past few days of posts. it’s a window into a bizarro world of sycophancy and propaganda.
this morey story is about to turn into a twitter contest for politicians and whew i recommend self-awareness before hitting send on those, fellas.
I’ve learned the hard way - but don’t engage with anti-trans activists.  If you do, your timeline is likely to be flooded with other anti-trans activists who don’t follow you, coordinated via huge Twitter DM groups (a lurking member of one has just alerted me) and Mumsnet (!)
Twitter is dangerous 😭.. they allow anythang on here.. porn and all 🤦🏽‍♂️
if you go to the president of the united states of america’s twitter and click his likes he only likes two tweets and one is a gay meme about him blocking me and at this point it’s just a normal sunday for me
The meltdown of Chiefs fans on this twitter machine is completely wild. Missing starting LT, LG, DT, DE, WR1, WR2 and the QB is dinged up... You're going to have a stinker sometimes. It happens. The Pats had multiple stinkers last season.
I have never seen politics Twitter more united than everyone shredding the NBA tonight for appeasing communist China
Love you guys! Enjoy the premiere! We realize none of us have cable hahaha but I’ll be checking twitter to interact with you guys as you watch🥰❤️😘
Just shared. Twitter can't silence all of us.
This appears that @glennbeck’s website URL is causing a “conversation quality” conversion. Which means impressions are not being shown on those links one step within those that follow me. So impressions are only within my followers.   @Twitter doesn’t want this to go viral.
Just noticed web twitter no longer lets you Ctrl-F find text if it's scrolled offscreen. Like if you lose your place on your timeline and try to search something you read, you can't do that anymore. @Jack is a twisted man who cannot tell the difference between pleasure and pain
cant think of a spooky halloween twitter name? just put "gamer" at the front of yours
Man, I'm sad I'll be out of town tomorrow, so I won't be able to say this right to him.  Twitter will do for now.  #GoPackGo @timthetatman
Projection + alcohol = Rudy Giuliani’s Twitter
Moments after Mercy was announced, I received kilograms of cooked Naija food at my door, sent in by a kind London based Twitter user. Her way of welcoming me. Felt like my own price for predicting that game right. No attempt to cook for the next few days! Lol.
.@soledadobrien THIS is what I meant by not letting this little mocking tweet of yours make things “nasty” my dear. You’re gonna be blocking #Blexit #WalkAway🇺🇸 #MAGA and #KAG for the next 7 Days by attacking me here on @Twitter for supporting the #FirstStepAct and @RealCandaceO
Today is the day I became public enemy #1 to centrist twitter.
The dude had a fucking heart attack and hid the info for three days but apparently it’s no big deal and now High Sparrow Twitter is all, “everyone has heart attacks all the time. I just had one while I was tweeting this and I’m totally fine.”
What a weekend of results folks 👍Happy days,and NO stick on Twitter 😉😂😂😂
📺 | Ali Milani, Labour's PPC in Boris's Uxbridge seat is one #FilthyPieceOfToeRag.  “Nah u won’t mate it will cost you a pound #jew,” he once said over Twitter.   Now claims he wants antisemitism eradicated "from our society as a whole."   Classic dishonest and dangerous Labour.
Hey Patriots!Big favor-could you please give a follow to @RealWalkAway? This is the #WalkAway Campaign’s twitter, but twitter will likely never verify the account. So you have it from me-this is the real deal! Plz give us a follow & PLZ RETWEET this to spread the word everywhere!
I want the confidence of celebrities using private jets every week & complaining about carbon footprint on Twitter like nothing happened. High time to call out their bullshit.
I went with THE BARBARADOOK! Thanks for all your suggestions Twitter Loves. Happy Halloween season!
Fuck you twitter for making me see six dead elephants.
Always interesting reading Twitter after a big decision that decides a game especially when it’s in Liverpool’s favour. The funny thing is all the different sets of fans complaining about the decision would 100% claim it’s a penalty if it were on one of there players 🤣
it’s 2019 and you still haven’t figured out that twitter polls will always backfire on you
I’m truly disappointed with every @gop elected who is afraid of Trump’s twitter feed.  If you ever wanted to be a patriot, there’s plenty of room at the podium.
Let’s see how much of a hellscape Twitter is. Whom do you respect more?
Just another day when the president of the United States is calling a member of his own party an "ass" on Twitter.
Dear Twitter Friends   As a Special Olympics Athletes   I been playing Special Olympics 18 years  I lost 40 pound  I play 6 sports  Softball Basketball Volleyball Track Bocce Golf ❤️  Could you ask your Twitter friends to follow me ❤️    I love to inspire everyone ❤️  Love you ❤️
IS THERE TWITTER IN PRISON ? ASKING FOR AN AMERICAN FRIEND
Last night we rocked a sick set at a Naija Independence Day party. 🇳🇬1000% vibes ... you people on twitter like to lie yoh.
Log off Twitter and enjoy your weekend. Don't dwell, don't feed into the negativity, don't let the negativity feed into your leisure time. This feels horrible but it isn't forever.
Hello @INCIndia before your twitter activism and cheap thrills at trolling try a bit of on ground action? Just saying.
#HappyBirthdayKhanSahb becomes the top Twitter trend in Pakistan as Prime Minister Imran Khan turns 67 years old today.   #ARYNews #HappyBirthdayImranKhan
If you spend all your time debating Martin Scorsese’s comic book thoughts or the #Joker movie then you won’t have enough energy to hate tweet Star Wars to death in December. Pace yourself, film twitter.
I see my Twitter friends starting businesses, families, podcasts, channels and relationships...   Going to The White House, running for office, raising children, travelling the world, seeking purpose, chasing goals...  It's beautiful. You guys and girls all inspire me! ☺️
The best thing I can say about @MittRomney is: I wouldn’t be checking Twitter at 10:30 on Friday to see if he was torturing immigrants to distract from his open crimes against America democracy. As so, with utmost grudgingness: Thank You, Romney, for at least saying something.
when you can't read her mind, read Twitter
Sorry I’ve been away from Twitter for a bit.  I was busy having insane sex with a young Marine. I hope it doesn’t get out & cause people to think, “Good for her!”
! Trump praises, at length, Terrence Williams, the comedian-commentator whose false claims about Clinton-Epstein and about Ilhan Omar he shared on Twitter. He calls Williams up to speak at the White House.
@twitter please handle this account, it appears to have been given to a child
this is just my annual tweet to let twitter know that candy corn is and always will be absolute trash
I just did a quick search of Donald Trump's very public twitter account and found dozens of "investigation requests" - it's one of his favorite things to do, in fact. He's asked about Democrats, Republicans, Media, Business figures, etc. Anyone who follows him knows this
Betting on sports requires roughly a 53% success rate to turn a profit assuming -110 on all games...  Hitting 55% to 60% (assuming -110) is a great season...  Using twitter/social media as a guide at least 75% of handicappers hit 65% or better...amazing books can stay in business
Then don’t just condemn on Twitter. Say something that means something—that he should resign or be impeached and removed. #ImpeachmentTaskForce
Sure, sex is great, but have you ever watched as your country teeters on the brink of a wholesale descent into fascist, authoritarian, racist, misogynist kleptocracy and all you can do is donate money, phonebank, and yell on Twitter?
It’s October 4th  Reply if you need a spooky name Like if your Twitter name is already ghastly RT if you respect and revere candy corn
People keep telling me, “oh you’re the one who lost $150K giving money away on Twitter”. I say, no, I’ve gained mentally, spiritually, and most importantly, helped a lot of other people. 🇺🇸
This just now ...”When do we finally leave the EU then ?” Me: “27 days time “ Him:”Not bloody soon enough “ Me”But you voted remain!” Him: “That’s before I realised what a bunch of uncompromising ba^*!$s they are”.. ( sorry I don’t do swearing on twitter 🙄 but you get the drift)
Dear Twitter,  It’s a beautiful Friday! Get out there today and do great things.  I want to challenge you to message someone you care about in life and just remind them how much they mean to you. Make someone’s day better.  With Love, Uncle Jack
1/Neoliberalism: a thread.  I was elected as the "Chief Neoliberal Shill" in a series of (rigged) Twitter polls in 2018, and deposed in 2019 by @mattyglesias.  It was sort of a joke. But the year I spent being called - and calling myself - a "neoliberal" taught me a lot.
I think it is *really* funny that men know how to pay attention to your mannerisms when it’s time to make IG/Twitter videos making fun of you, but don’t know how to translate those skills into being better partners.
YES IM HIGH YES IM DRUNK YES O SHOULDNT BE ON TWITTER YES ITS TRUE
I think it’s a good thing that I’ve lost over $150,000 by giving away stuff on Twitter because we’ve helped soooo many people. What do you think? Do you agree?
I’ve lost over $150,000 cash by giving away money on Twitter
Fox & Friends is talking about Robert DeNiro this morning, so expect a long twitter tirade from Trump attacking DeNiro in an hour
In the last 24 hours both Ben Bradshaw and Richard Burgon have been caught out making things up, creating Twitter storms which were subsequently debunked pretty easily. Looks like the general election campaign has started...
I will have a lot to say about the Paris stabber very soon. Twitter is suspending whoever shares critical information regarding his identity. I will quote-retweet this tweet later when this cools down, and speak the truth about what is going on. I’ll use the hashtag #Parisattack.
I really want a Halloween-ish twitter name for this month, but I seriously can't think of one. You guys have ideas??
Hey @jack @TwitterSupport - is it now okay for people on twitter to be advocating for violent rape of other users? You seem to think it’s okay based on the fact that you allow users to post such messages without any consequences. Why does Twitter think rape is okay?
Vibe check
No wonder #DoNothingDonald is trending. Still nothing on:  Infrastructure  China trade North Korea Iran Healthcare Deficit Spending Mass Gun Murders Immigration  And whines on Twitter all day long.
The President of the United States is screaming out his crimes on Twitter...   ...and it's barely news.  Is this rock bottom?

Are confessions on Twitter valid?
Brian Stelter just said on CNN international that Trump use of twitter seems less impactful   Quoting George Conway saying Trump is not fit for office.   Is this the Onion?
Rudy Giuliani just tweeted the phone number of someone he communicated with in the Ukraine scandal. That's a violation of Twitter terms of service.
Donald Trump tweets a doctored Nickelback video.  Nickelback convinces Twitter to remove the video from Trump's tweet.  Rudy Giuliani then tweets the same doctored Nickelback video.  Trump and Rudy are idiots.
Yes I’ll re-write a tweet with a typo. I’m already on Twitter. I clearly have no shame.
If he does it in private, it's only "hearsay." If on twitter, that's "just twitter." If in front of TV cameras, it's "he's only joking."  GOP has excuses to cover all contingencies.
Ms Harris I think trying to get twitter to suspend the presidents  or anybody else’s account because you don’t like what he says  is the very essence of fascism Webster describes it: “a tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control”
My favorite moments on twitter are the hour or two of quiet from Trump's defenders after he blows up their talking points and they have to retreat to come up with new ones
I keep saying this, but the amazing thing about Donald Trump is he is endlessly confessing in public. You don't need secret tapes. You just need to turn a camera on him, or give him a phone connected to Twitter.
Twitter has removed Trump’s Nickelback video due to a copyright complaint. Good.
I just woke up to text messages for my password reset on my rich man account... check Twitter and see EA have leaked everyone’s personal details again. I was hacked 5 times from 2014-2015. Had to change my phone number twice because EA kept giving up my info. Such a joke. #FIFA20
In these dark times, a couple of my favorite spiritual Twitter users are @PB_Curry and @TheRaDR. Who are yours? And, if religion's not for you, I'd also love to have your recommendations for users who keep you connected to what matters.
Maybe you got blocked bc someone used Twitter Blockchain & you were an unfortunate casualty. It happens.   Maybe you were blocked bc your behavior was less praiseworthy than the story you tell yourself.   Humility is good. So is remembering that nobody owes you access.
You and Kellie are like the Joel Steinberg and Hedda Nussbaum of attacking a kid on Twitter.
Hey Twitter. Fuck you.
Handy Twitter accounts to follow for #StormLorenzo 🆘 @emergencyIE ⚡️ @ESBNetworks 💨 @MetEireann 🚓 @gardainfo @GardaTraffic ⚓️ @IrishCoastGuard 💧 @IrishWater @IWCare 🆘 @opwireland   Also check your local authority   #Lorenzo
it cracks me up when normie twitter tries to make fun of ravers for headbanging like we don’t know we look funny lmao of course we do but it’s called having fun bro, i highly recommend
Twitter has taught me that adults are only slightly more mature than children once you give them a smartphone and free time.
Friends, I reached a twitter milestone today.Thanks to my followers for your wisdom-learn so much from you. It feels like we’ve been through a lot together. The next 13 months will be a roller coaster, but with our work, we’ll have a better country on the other side Let’s do this
If you changed your twitter name for Halloween you’re a bottom now
The #FaceaFaceTVA debate starts in a few minutes. I'm turning over my twitter account to my team, who'll be tweeting along this evening. Let's go!
We can have a conversation about black folk and our unconscionable forgiveness in the face of hate and violence. I don’t get it.   I recognize two things, Twitter ain’t the space for this dialogue and I’m not that far along in my Christian journey.
I just don’t really know how to Twitter u know.  Lol  I love y’all tho
Twitter friends,  Cloakzy and Alexia are at the house! No stream today but I’m thinking of VLOGing!  Who wants a 100T house VLOG with all of us?!  With Love, Uncle Jack
2nd day NOT watching @MSNBC & my 2nd day of asking WHY @JoyAnnReid has been silenced on twitter.  Why, @MSNBC? Did you do it? Are you the reason?  I will remind you that she is the ONLY black, female voice with a show on your ENTIRE network which is crazy enough. But this? Naw.
In Las Vegas, @PeteButtigieg was asked if he agrees with Sen. Kamala Harris urging Twitter to suspend President Trump's account: "I'm less worried about the president’s access to twitter than his access to the nuclear codes."
Trump is using the word "BULLSHIT" on Twitter and saying people should be prosecuted for treason and subtlety threatening to start a civil war  It's all to distract the public from the BASIC FACTS  TRUMP ASKED THE LEADER OF A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE HIS POLITICAL RIVAL
Today on Twitter, I was told that I don't know the difference between fictional and reality television, and that I need to read up on "the debates" of early America to learn something about the American founding and the nation's former crises.  How's your day going?
someone I’ve never met before and their only contact with me is through following me on twitter just said I’m a completely different person..do you see why i fucking hate the internet??YOU DONT KNOW MEEEEEEEEEEEEE I’m a literally stranger to you why is that so hard to understand
REPORTER: “Should Donald Trump be banned from Twitter?”  ELIZABETH WARREN: *laughs* “No.”
.@realDonaldTrump tells newser "believe it or not I watch my words carefully" adds: "I am a very stable genius" on same day he uses "bull**** on twitter, says @RepAdamSchiff can't carry Pompeo's 'blank' strap," says @SpeakerPelosi "hands out subpoenas like they're cookies"
President Trump, who spent the last few days cursing on Twitter, accusing people of treason, and suggesting the Dems’ impeachment inquiry might lead to a Civil War says today at the White House, “I watch my words very closely.”
The President of the United States is cursing on Twitter, Bernie is in the hospital and rapper Gucci Mane is the face of Gucci.   It’s only 1pm.
If I won the lottery tomorrow, I’d pay off my debts, go to seminary full time, and ignore politics. It’s pathetic to see the President on Twitter behaving like that, his fans cheering him on, and the media responding in kind.
If u get banned on Twitter I can’t help u out.  I’ve already explained to Twitter in detail that there’s an exploit & that hundreds of Fortnite Twitter accounts were banned. Got hundreds unbanned but twitter has not fixed it. I don’t get paid to work for Twitter , I quit.
You know what I would value? A Twitter account called Wait, What's Everyone Talking About? that would provide a link to whatever everyone is talking about.
Seriously, you have to enjoy trump melting down on twitter. It’s payback for his bigotry, racism and sexism.
Hi Twitter! What are you grateful for? I’m grateful for #oneteam
A lot of folks who have “constitutionalist” in their Twitter bios seem very angry that Congress is trying to uphold the...wait for it...constitution.   Weird.
I've been on twitter for like 15 minutes today, and the disgusting celebrations I see for a presidential candidate going to the hospital are making me think this should be a low social media day.
It looks like thugs at @Twitter are shadow-banning our account again.  Too much info confronting the far left hoaxers and exposing their latest impeachment scam.
Inbox: In a formal letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Senator Kamala Harris is urging the company to suspend President Donald Trump's account, pointing to a series of tweets that plainly violate the Twitter User Agreement.
Big giveaway in next 60 minutes. Be Ready, Team! This is gonna shake Twitter. This one is big. Gonnna surprise some people who have their notification on and are quick to RT when it comes out 🤗
Do you guys like how I’m probably the nicest (and certainly most generous 😊) guy on twitter but I also don’t take other people’s efforts to hurt us? We must protect ourselves, our families, and our country!
The issue is just about fixed. You should be able to access Twitter as usual. If not, give it a few more minutes! Thanks for waiting.
A Porn Star Stalker “begged” me for money. Porn Star Stalker sent me inappropriate photos (my wife and I weren’t happy) so I set boundary and blocked her. Didn’t give her my money, then she goes nuts against us on Twitter. I still love her anyway! 🤣☀️❤️

TWITTER WHAT IS WRONG WITH U TODAY!!
We've been experiencing outages across Twitter and TweetDeck. You might have had trouble Tweeting, getting notifications, or viewing DMs. We're currently working on a fix, and should be back to normal soon.
apparently gifs aren’t working on twitter right now? as you can imagine this is a difficult time for us. godspeed everyone. we will get through this.
Twitter won't let us post videos right now but we swear that was electric!!!! #Postseason #WePlayLoud
Guys...I’m almost at 1,000,000 followers on Twitter.  That’s insane because there are only 7,000,000 people in the world. I’m blessed 💯👀😅✅😛
Twitter is not letting me post my Spooky Ookie Season Post 😭😭👻
Joe Biden is trying to keep Rudy Giuliani off TV  Kamala Harris wants to kick @realDonaldTrump off Twitter  Cory Booker wants Trump to cancel his rallies  What is the left so afraid of?  If Trump's ideas were so bad—shouldn't they let him speak?  🤔

It is disgusting how Meghan has been treated by the media. I agree with Harry that such behaviour has dire consequences to human lives. This is why I had to do murder on the dance floor with your twitter dons because I won’t condone this culture of violence.
I strongly disagree with people arguing for suspending Trump from Twitter, but maybe not for the same reasons others might have. I long ago gave up on security concerns about his tweeting; now I think it's important to have a daily record of his admissions about his own actions.
If you don’t love me at my Twitter you don’t deserve me at my Instagram main feed
Get your search on. DM search is rolling out to everyone on iOS today.
Dear Twitter,  Be the best version of yourself today. Spread positive energy to those around you. Take some time later to clean your room/home and you will feel infinitely better.  Order yourself your favorite dinner tonight too. You deserve it.  With Love, Uncle Jack

Donald Trump’s use of Twitter has gone from dog whistles to pure calls to action to incite violence in America.   The fact that Twitter won’t suspend him because they profit on the traffic he drives is despicable.
Nothing yet from @eir. I literally have NO other way of contacting them about Mammy Keyes's broken landline except Twitter. I rang Dun Laoghaire store but it went to a full mailbox. I hate to be that person but lads, any chance of an RT? Think of Old Vumman! All alone and worried
I can’t tell if I preferred life before twitter. I’d spend weeks blissfully unaware of world events and then find them out all at once in a stifling cacophony of horror. Whereas now they just continually trickle in to my awareness as a dull underlying dread
The 'Political Correctness' chapter in my book provides a full account of the non-story from 2013 about Radstock council in Somerset supposedly 'banning' the union flag to appease muslims. Incredibly, it's been resurrected on Twitter & endorsed by people who *must* know better.
GOOD IDEA: Trump's "Twitter account should be suspended," Kamala Harris said on AC360. "There's plenty of…evidence to suggest that he is irresponsible with his words in a way that could result in harm…so the privilege of using those words that way should ... be taken from him."
Using twitter is just microdosing anxiety
On any given day, POTUS provides more in his twitter feed than President Nixon did with his devastating smoking gun tape. And then Giuliani offers a new confession with each television interview.
Every time I refresh my twitter feed he’s colluded with another foreign power
MOM TWITTER 🗣 Must haves as a first time mom for your hospital bag? I’m shopping for mine! 😭
Look let's be honest, @realDonaldTrump's Twitter account should be suspended.
Twitter person- Tony Posnanski is a fucking asshole grifter fuckface who sells shit stick figure doodles and only says fuck and shit and fuck him.  Me- Fuck You.  Twitter person- OMG TONY POSNANSKI FINALLY RESPONDED TO ME HI I LOVE YOUR WEIGHT LOSS STORY AND ALL YOUR TWEETS!!!
My friend Max (who isn’t on Twitter) just texted me: “If this administration were melting any faster, Greta Thunberg would be giving a speech about it to the UN.”
Everyone’s freaking out on twitter with such vague referents that I have no idea which of the many things to freak out about anyone is freaking out about
At 7pm EST tonight a number of conservative influencers & myself are going to drop a project on Twitter that we want EVERYONE’S help with. This will be a FUN & VERY POSITIVE thing for us all to engage in during this time when POTUS could use our friendly support. Everybody ready?

Siri how do I give myself muscles in Photoshop wait don't post to Twitter stop undo undo
If you showed the president's recent Twitter feed to a veteran police officer or detective, I bet they'd tell you the unhinged and frantic search for fabricated proof of innocence sounds like a man who knows he's been caught & desperately hopes his other crimes aren't uncovered.

Sometimes I’m like, “wow twitter is always so negative, it’s a real mood killer, I should delete it.” And then sometimes I’m like “hi twitter I love u” at 1 AM.
1. A tweet storm: I have a column coming from the @nytopinion soon about Facebook’s Supreme Court of Content, but related is this utterly Twitter rule-violating tweet from Trump hiding behind a quote from a truly appalling pastor  about a possible Civil War if he were impeached.
Twitter: Your hashtag emoji is back  Our brain: Don't do it                  Don't do it                  Don't do it                  Don't do it  Us: #GoStars #GoStars #GoStars #GoStars #GoStars #GoStars #GoStars #GoStars #GoStars #GoStars #GoStars #GoStars #GoStars #GoStars
One of the joys of trending on Twitter for saying something “offensive”, “insensitive”, “callous”, etc., are all those inoffensive, sensitive, compassionate people who tweet you to say how disappointed they are you’re not dead.
it kills me everyday that we didnt have Twitter when Malice at the Palace happened
Dear Black Twitter:  If a second Civil War starts your only hope for survival will be the Black men and women you labeled "problematic", "toxic" and "trash".   You ain't stopping white nationalist militias with thinkpieces full of seven syllable words, hashtags and Beyonce GIFs.
Take a nice deep breath. Close the Twitter and spend just a few moments with yourself in the richness and fullness of now.
He, @DrJoeAbah was one of my references for an application. When I went for the interview, the interviewer spent the first 5 minutes telling me about how kind he was to her when she worked with him. Twitter is obsessed with attempting to take people down because they just are!
Wakes up to find 'Civil War' trending on twitter. Did someone say we are heading toward another Civil War? Let's try to better understand the one we already fought before predicting another one.
Zero faith in Ole as a manager or as a tactician tbh now would be a good time to let SAF to do the team talk! This is the ONE GAME that erupts Football Twitter we need a miracle! #mufc
true introvert culture when your twitter account is 99% retweets of other peoples tweets and only 1% your own tweets and all your own tweets are either like “aaaAAAAAAAA ADJSKFHAKDHS” or “im sad”
By calling for a "Civil War" tonight, Donald Trump has committed treason. He may have also violated Twitter's terms of service.
I always get reminded Twitter is for depressed ppl.. get ya tickets 2 tHe tour. I tweeted all day wit u n words 🕺🏾
How does threatening a Civil War not get Trump suspended from Twitter?
Dear Republican Senators: Please look at this maniac’s Twitter meltdown tonight. “Civil war?” He’s mentally unbalanced. He’s unfit to serve. He is going to hurt people. You need to do your fucking jobs and get rid of him NOW...#Trump.
Tonight's twitter meltdown by the US President, filled with threats and lies, is not helping his case against impeachment and removal from office. He is obviously unfit and dangerous to US.
Twitter. Tell @Official_Tink kiss 5 waiting on her. 🌹
Mr. @jmacyoung just DM's me and called me all sorts of names, including "You gutless piece of fly shit" for my appearance on Meet the Press today. Life in America in 2019. So depressing. Blocking now.  Not sure what  @twitter terms of service are for such things. Moving on.
Another Red Sox season in the books, my 14th covering the team. Thanks to everyone for reading the blogs, listening to @Section10Pod, watching the vlogs, having fun on Twitter, coming to the meet and greets and the live shows. Disappointing season, but you guys are the best.
people on twitter night mode will always ask "why are you on light mode" but people on light mode never ask "why are you on dark mode". we just vibing out scrolling with our stronger superior eyes.
Tomorrow night at 7pm EST, a number of conservative influencers and myself will be dropping a campaign on twitter that we want ALL OF YOU to get involved with. You’re gonna love it. Be on the lookout tomorrow night on Twitter- 7pm EST.
Presidents of the United States have more information at their fingertips than anyone on the planet. But President Trump pushes crazy conspiracy theories, lies, and has his view of the world shaped Fox News bloviators and a Twitter echo chamber of propagandists.
I saw Sebastian Vettel stop & pick up some rubbish today (water bottles) as he walked to the interview pen. He actively came out of the pen after his DNF specifically to do that. Just a little reminder we are all human and I wish twitter wasn’t so negative.  #F1 #RussianGP #BBCF1
Notice!  Please note that the Football Manager, Bobby Motaung is not on Twitter. There are several accounts out there impersonating him.  Any Tweets from these accounts do not represent him or the Club.  #Amakhosi4Life
Twitter is my favorite sport!
All of us on twitter are going to die and leave our TL behind some day.   Would be unfortunate if you die while your TL is sucking up to or kissing the ass of some politician who has never heard of you. Let your tweets reflect your courage and not your cowardice.
If @jack @twitter continues to allow bots, anonymous fake troll accounts and "purchased" followers, they'll prosper only as long as it takes for someone to launch something identical to twitter that does not allow the deception and corruption of bots, trolls and bought followers.
Here's a shout out to all the followers of @thewire_in on Twitter—there are now half a million of you! The Wire is the first independent all-digital news platform launched in the past decade to reach this milestone.
I don't say this enough but my run on Twitter has been amazing and unexpected and whatnot. Thank you for dealing with my bullshit and so forth, what have you.
Well you cannot impeach land.   Secondly, more people in that land voted for the other person.   Third and this could be the first, may be the dumbest post ever on twitter.
How I would love to see a moratorium on all press pieces that begin with “Twitter Reacts To”
If you think @realDonaldTrump @twitter feed is bizarre could you imagine him on the phone with an audience? He speaks glibly like he is an antagonist in Hollywood and not the @potus. He is impetuous and often play acting. This will be his undoing. He will ensnare his team too.
I wonder if Trump will have Twitter privileges in prison?!  It would be fun to see him tweeting about how unfair the warden and other inmates are to him.
I need Sunday to be only cat videos on Twitter 😵
Tonight is my first-ever elementary school reunion.   I wasn’t particularly popular. And I haven’t laid eyes on any of these people since 1978. Forty-one years!  How can I casually slip in the phrase “139 thousand Twitter followers?”  Lol. I’ll keep you all posted. 😎

"Give me an offer. I don't need money but I need to play with great team and great team mate!"  Former Japan international Keisuke Honda has hinted at his desire to play for Manchester United by attempting to contact them on Twitter...👀
Over 4000 twitter accounts have been suspended by Indian employees working at Twitter for raising their voices against genocide in Kashmir. @Twitter must immediately take action against such employees & restore all accounts & protect their freedom of speech! #IndiaHijackedTwitter

If I remember    A song was made for Yetty and I didnt see the hot takes o.    Like I have always said    On twitter its never about the crime,  but always about the person involved
Scrolling twitter is weird sometimes because it’s like “the world is on fire and we’re gunna die in 20 years” and then in the same second “JLo looks like she’s 23 but she’s 94”
Did anyone ask him why he’s all of a sudden gotten so quiet when just a few weeks ago he was offering daily critiques of “legal pundits” on twitter?
BREAKING: A Federal Judge in New York City has ordered Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes to testify,  In a lawsuit that claims her blocking critics on Twitter infringes upon their 1st Amendment rights.  We tried to reach out to @AOC for comment, but she blocked us...

first Tweet, best Tweet
Naija Twitter is so happy today. So many things to talk about. Iz Like nothing much happening for days now. The horror. Congrats y'all lol
Let's settle this. What is the GREATEST Tweet?
The highlight of Halas Hall today ...  @JJStankevitz: “You’re a big basketball guy, does it still tickle you that LeBron James gives you shoutouts on Twitter?”  Khalil Mack: “Whatcha you say? Tickle? I’m a grown man.”
People on Twitter keep telling me that I’m going to hell for my sins. I try to reassure them that I’ll be fine down there and not to worry. Boiling heat all day with all my girl friends complaining about their hair getting frazzled is just a usual summer holiday to me.
For anybody appalled at my Twitter mentions right now, I urge you to consider:  All I did this morning was stand up and speak about well-known and accepted history, loud and clear.  #Facts and #history are threatening to #Hindutva ideologues, really threatening.
btw, don’t be afraid to unfollow Trump on Twitter. it’s really quite wonderful

For all the people really shook about my endorsing EW, harness your energy, get the fuck off twitter and go change peoples minds instead of being hateful online. I can’t imagine Bernie would disagree with that.
Idea for @twitter, how about when someone registers for an account who is under the age of 18, you send them an option to automatically delete all Tweets they sent before they were 18 when they turn 18 years old? Seems like a really smart option to create.
I wonder if Trump will have Twitter privileges in prison?!  It would be fun to see him tweeting about how unfair the warden and other inmates are to him.
On a percentage basis, people on Bitcoin Twitter understand what money is better than people on Wall Street.

This is my only account.  Please do not listen to anyone else pretending to be me.  There are SO MANY GRIFTERS out there across Twitter, trying to get your PERSONAL DATA (they DOXXED ME).  Grifters will try to get you to send them money personally.  STOP THE GRIFTERS!
Don’t you hate it when Pres Trump obstructs by hiding a transcript by putting it out on twitter...
Taxi driver in London told me this morning: "aren't you that guy from Twitter who makes up fictional conversations with taxi drivers?" Me: "yes" Him: "I love your work, you're the best"
Donald Trump is being impeached for interfering in the elections through abuse of power.   Through Twitter as a citizen of India and not as a Congress Spokesperson,I ask of the @BJP4India to disclose to us:  Who all have funded you through Electoral Bonds?   If you care, RT/share
It’s hard to sleep when there’s a treacherous corrupt sexist racist lying con artist in charge of our country threatening war in the middle of the night on Twitter.
During promotion of Force 2 @TheJohnAbraham & I were sitting in a TV studio, chatting. Someone had leaked his mobile number & he was a bit worried.  Today a Pakistani hacked into a friend’s Twitter account & leaked my number.   By God, star wali feeling aa rahi hai.  ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️
I told Adnan to give Shawn’s family my contact if they wanted to reach out and that we’d respect their privacy and anonymity. His wife reached out and we fortuitously bumped into each other in the cafeteria when she told us the Twitter story. 6/
Shawn, who is wisely not on Twitter, picked up Rida’s phone and clicked on my thread. He turned to his wife and said, “Oh, I’m O blood type. I’ll apply.” Last Friday, we were told there was an anonymous donor and the surgery was scheduled for Tuesday. 4/
Shawn regularly donates blood and has even given bone marrow. His wife, Rida, told me she follows me on Twitter and was keeping up with Nusayba’s journey. She was devastated to read about our search for a new donor. 3/

Hey twitter. I see #CancelNYT trending. What's up with that?   [Starts to hear why]  Let me stop you. 10 years ago when the NYT gave you an assurance, it meant something. Now some of their people print off-the-record comments & mention what you said to other interviewees by name.
Wait – did the New York Times reveal the identity of the whistleblower? For real? That’s a thing that happened in the hour I was off Twitter?
I went scrolling through #maga Twitter just now.   It's nuts. And I'm not even talking about trolls/Trump voters - I'm talking about blue-tick pseudo-journalists & pretend-pundits.  That the dominant subsection of the right is bonkers is not discussed enough by the mainstream.
Anyone else notice AB gets twitter lonely before kickoff every Thursday and Sunday?
The name on his twitter bio is literally "AB"

Some of the kindest, smartest, most interesting, successful and helpful people in the world are on Twitter.  So are some of the cruelest, most negative, most annoying and dumbest.  You can connect with them all.   Choose wisely...
Been stopped by a man on the train who said "Are you an MP? Ben Bradley? I thought so... I'm afraid I'm not on your side, but I'll move up so you can have this seat".  A reminder that in the world outside Westminster and Twitter, people are polite and, for the most part, kind.
twitter in 2019 is waking up and checking if the british or us government or both collapsed while u were sleeping

What are all the popular twitter love teams?
FWIW, your Twitter feed this AM is like the helicopter flying overhead scene in Goodfellas.
Transport Twitter is always full of arguments about how a move away from cars in cities could negatively affect accessibility for disabled people.   What I don't see is anyone really spelling out the case for how it would *positively* affect accessibility.  So, thread.
I wonder if the atmosphere in Parliament is partly down to social media. Many of them are playing to their online constituency, looking for that viral home-run. Just like actual Twitter it’s caused a runaway escalation of hyperbole & crassness.
Imagine reading that an MP has reported a death threat to their infant child to the police, then logging on to twitter and posting "sad but not surprising given her position on Brexit", imagine that being where you are as a person
Hey biased  @TwitterIndia @Twitter @TwitterSupport  Why is @ravibhadoria suspended?   Why is @AjaySengar_ suspended?  Please Restore their Twitter handle ASAP.   #ISupportRaviBhadoria
. @TwitterIndia Suspended  @SameerViews @AjaySengar_ @ravibhadoria without any specific reason. This is not the first time Nationalists accounts suspended by twitter
Man do I love Twitter. So many smart, funny normal people outside of the media bubble to share the moment with. Requires Twitter hygiene (blocking people who argue in bad faith or are unnecessarily rude, and you bet I do) but it is worth it. Thanks for making it fun.
She is not. In a week in which she knew I had received death threats she directed her hundreds of thousands of twitter followers to the address of my family home. No responsible broadcaster would give her a platform @talkRADIO.
During my search of Twitter accounts, I found a lot of fireable material.  Unless the person actively participated in mobbing, I discretely DM'ed + deleted DM. Convo never happened.   Reporters who can't give a "heads up" to a civilian like Carson King want War.
Kyle Dubas found out about the Auston Matthews incident on Twitter. He phoned Auston immediately and said the player was honest about what happened.

Just got home.   From the reaction on Twitter, it sounds like Trump's press conference solved everything?
Trump says world leaders have been approaching him today to tell him no U.S. president has ever gone through so much. Trump said himself this morning on Twitter that no president has ever been treated so poorly.
Remoaners on Twitter call Leavers racists, fascists, far right, xenophobes, liars, ignorant, uneducated and even express glee at elderly Leave voters dying off.   Brexiteer PM says the words “surrender” and “humbug” and they all reach for the smelling salts.  Gimme a break.
If it wasn't for Twitter, we'd all be running up and down the streets, shouting our reactions to the news at strangers.
Don't let Twitter, Democrats, and the mainstream media lie to you  The word "favor" in the Ukraine transcript was used in reference to "Crowdstrike"—an ongoing investigation into election interference  The favor had absolutely NOTHING to do with Joe Biden  RT to spread the truth!
Everyone in America is pretending to work, but just listlessly scrolling Twitter.
“ACTUALLY it’s not a transcript” Twitter is already the worst Twitter
We are now in the stage of grief on Twitter/media where the media and other Resistance folks are realizing that their assertions without evidence that the transcript is "bad" are not being bought by people who don't share their extreme anti-Trumpist bias.
The specificity of this Tweet. Where is the Virgo in your chart
You wouldn't be the brilliam person you are today without these phenominall Tweets. You're extraordinharry
day mode is a raw diet
Twitter is bottling up primary challengers by refusing to verify them, which is a killer on the campaign trail.   @CoriBush ran a credible challenge in 2018 and starred in a damn movie about it and still @jack won’t verify her.   If you’re a primary challenger hurt by this, DM me
Delete your twitter history  Do it now  Thank me later
Hey Twitter. I might have some news for you later today.
About 50 percent of my Twitter feed seems to think that if Trump is impeached he'll automatically be thrown out of office. It is a good idea to learn a thing or two about how our system works before you start speaking on the matter publicly.
Bitches don’t be running shit but they fingers on Twitter 😂😂
Imagine being one of the 80+% of Americans who don't use Twitter and trying to figure out what the hell Democrats are smoking  Democrats are a caricature of themselves from 10 years ago  Socialist, gun grabbing, tax hiking, etc
BREAKING: Supreme Court admits yesterday’s ruling was wrong as constitutional expert John17253338 on Twitter points out they are a bunch of “remoaner wankers”.

On a day that is otherwise not funny, it is amusing to see liberal Twitter fanatics wring their hands over the supposedly imminent possibility of a President Pence. Suggesting they are unaware of the whole you-need-67-votes-in-the-Senate-to-convict part of impeachment.
He will devour himself on Twitter before this is all over.  #impeachment #ImpeachTrump
You’re making Antonio Brown’s meltdown on Twitter look normal.
Lol love watching you meltdown on twitter. Soooooo much fun!
Trump is about to lose his shit on Twitter in 3...2....1  Expect a lot of random capitalization and one big run-on sentence.   #impeachment
I wish I had a picturesque place to remember where I was when I heard. But as usual I'm just on Twitter. Still, crying.
hey y’all twitter somehow let me in their office, tweet me questions you want answered. We’re spilling tea...... #AskBrittanyBroski
Twitter feels like I'm just constantly reading a drunk newspaper.
I love how all of Twitter has agreed to forget that literally one week ago, moderate Dems were quoted all over the place raging in public that Dems had to back off on impeachment.  Now the story has suddenly become, "heroic moderate Dems forcing Pelosi's hand."  Come on.

Oh dear. My Twitter today has turned into a cesspool of presumptuous, uninformed left-leaning people saying ugly things. Some have said my child should be taken away or that my end should come soon. I’m going to eat a burger and feel grateful for the 2nd Amendment.
Dear Twitter,  It has come to my attention that @Nadeshot, @timthetatman, and @Ninja think Interstellar is better than Inception.  I regret to inform you all that as of today I’m no longer friends with any of them. It’s a sad time but it’s for the better.  With Love, Uncle Jack
NEW: In federal court, lawyers for law professor Alan Dershowitz argued that their client is “ immune” from defamation claims no matter how many times he repeats them on Twitter...
Who's to say whether the government acted unlawfully? Is it a Twitter user with a Union Jack avatar, or 11 of the 12 most senior judges in the country in a unanimous decision? You've got to look at both sides.
Sometimes I get annoyed when people call me adorable but then I look at my twitter feed and I’m like, “ugh I AM adorable.”
I’m in LA. And I’ve got to say. The lack of interest in our country falling apart is astounding. Small pockets of ppl are outraged. But... It feels like a microcosm for all of America. PS- the folks on twitter do NOT represent even a fracture of America. Obvi you guys are engaged

Uni academics on Twitter arguing for rights of paedophiles & MAPS under LGBT banner. Gay activists have spent decades fighting against slur of being child abusers but the new order embraces it. Our children need protecting from Queer Theory which has influenced schools to NSPCC.
I’ve had a lousy few days. And it is fine. I am just using twitter for what one is supposed to use twitter for, complaining pointlessly.
The sentence: "Don't believe everything you read on Twitter", reads the same backwards.
A quick explanation of Twitter age guidelines:  16 - Not old enough for Greta Thunberg to know what she’s doing  15 - Old enough for Shamima Begum to know what she’s doing  11 - Old enough to choose to go to private school by yourself & be hypocritical if you’re now anti them
I HAVE LOUD OPINIONS ON EVERY SINGLE FUCKING SUBJECT I JUST DONT PUT THEM ON TWITTER YOU’RE GONNA HAVE TO GO DRINKING WITH ME TO HEAR THEM
The most powerful man in the world uses his Twitter account to attack a teenage girl and it will be forever archived as part of the Presidential Records Act in the National Archives. What a weird and shameful part of American history in the Trump era.
Impeachment Twitter eatin tonight
Today the howls I am hearing on the perfidy of China on twitter is the same type as in the 1970s I heard from the Communist stooges for urging that we must improve our relations with US because of its technological prowess. Knee jerk imbeciles

The man who released classified intel to Kremlin agents in the Oval Office and released classified intel to the man who had a Post reporter assassinated and released classified intel about our military on Twitter doesn't want you to see his "pitch-perfect" discussion with Ukraine
Life is short, so be sure to have as many vicious fights w/anonymous strangers on Twitter as possible; especially the kind that totally enrage & drain you.
Important message as we enter the next Bitcoin bull market:  - BTC is very volatile - You can lose all of your money - Only invest what is ok to lose - Twitter is not investment advice - Don't buy BTC with credit cards - Keep low time preference - Do your own research  🙏🏽🙏🏽
Y'all weren't saying "y'all" this much before using Twitter and observing how some of us talk but it's ok 😘
imagine looking in the mirror and saying yes, this is who I have decided to be, a grown man absolutely losing my shit at a 16 year old girl on Twitter in order to protect the Koch brothers' bottom line for free
A pretty good way of cleaning up your twitter feed right now is seeing which people you follow are angry about Greta Thunberg spreading a positive message and unfollowing them immediately because they are probably a twat.
I often think about the time a woman in my office said good morning, and I said good morning back, and then later I saw a twitter thread from her that was like “My mission today was to be kind to a coworker who always seems like he’s in a bad mood. The way his face lit up—“
BIG thanks to our 5 friends that were the cameramen - @ownthelight, twitter-less Kirk, @ItsBobbyMares & @DavidAlvareeezy & for all the behind the scene photos posted - @notalent_la !  thank u guys for taking time to film for us for 2 days straight. we love u, & appreciate u.
Should my *real* sister join Twitter, and help give out some money?
Let me say, Mr. President @BarackObama I would like to politely request that you follow me back on Twitter. I’ll be getting ready to run for Congress here in LA-03 fairly soon, and it seems likely that a Southern Democrat could use your guidance and any available assistance.
If I could give any piece of advice to young people working very hard to amass a large following on twitter specifically: don’t  You don’t want this
Oh but we have. Change your display on web 🌸
Twitter lowkey better than instagram
Attention: Twitter will be closing in 15 minutes. If you have any additional tweets, please bring them to the checkout counter now.
Maharashtra elections are such an anti-climax. @INCIndia has given up b4 the battle has started. No local face. @RahulGandhi is now just a @Twitter troll who surfaces once in a while to troll @narendramodi. @priyankagandhi has nothing to showcase other than her ‘dadi jaisi Naak’
I’m not watching the Emmys but mystical Twitter forces are causing me to imagine Julia Garner winning for her amazing performance in The Americans.
Wow. My friend Randa and I just watched a woman in the nail salon ask to speak with the manager and the owner because they were under staffed and backed up. It was painful. Like, girl, take it to twitter and leave those hard working people alone.
I don’t know what happens when you deactivate a twitter account. Do all 500,000 of my followers just slowly come back over time? Right now it says I have 0, and it says I’m following 0 people which isn’t true. Can anyone see my posts?
You need help.   I hope @Twitter suspends you for this hateful tweet. That sweet girl is fighting for her life because the orange shitgibbon is content to let the earth catch literal fire, you idiotic P.O.S.   Damn. You are TRASH.
Things the First Amendment restrains:   ❌Twitter ❌Facebook ❌The moderator on a message board ❌Your parents ✅The government ❌Chuck Norris
Twitter has gradually added features to enable high-profile users to insulate themselves from criticism, with the "hide replies" feature being the latest example. This is done in the name of combatting "toxicity." Of course, people sometimes deserve "toxic" criticism
Metaphorically speaking, no matter what the story, some dude on Twitter will defend arresting the six year old.
Sunday’s on Twitter are always wild.. lol. Have a Great one! 💥🤛🏽
For the changing mood of Arsenal fans... try watching a game unfold on Twitter. 1-0 down, the world is going to end, sack the manager, no progress, it’s all rubbish. Win 3-2. Amazing, heroes, they’d never do this under Wenger, drop Xhaka*  * actually they say this win or lose
Remember how Carl would sometimes say “That’s it I’m leaving Twitter forever“? Then he would be back on 2 hours later with an update: a hotdog from somewhere special & a cackle of glee? Carl was a great cook & shared every moment of his life with us & I already miss it. #rip
Twitter!  For when you’re too depressed for Instagram.  SEND
I honestly think the annoyingness of a certain candidate's supporters on Twitter prevents other reporters/analysts from pointing out that said candidate's campaign obviously isn't going that well.
Antonio Brown’s Twitter tirade this morning is the end of his career. He’s addicted to social media & it has cost him tens of millions. What most athletes don’t realize is your brand only matters if you’re excellent at your job — playing sports.
Apparently someone legit needs to get to Antonio Brown, not AB the persona, Antonio Brown. "He's out of control & not listening," I'm told. Periodic twitter tirades, not entertaining, may be alarms. Intercession mentioned as an idea.
Awesome! My name is Tony, and you can go fuck yourself and so can your husband, you homophobic assholes. Welcome to Twitter.
After Antonio Brown’s latest Twitter tirade this morning, one NFL source texted: “Kraft never writing that check, no matter what the ruling is now.”
Welcome Second Lady @KarenPence to Twitter as she works to help re-elect @realDonaldTrump & @Mike_Pence!
Women journalists of Twitter: advice please. What is the correct way to be a journalist?
Hello it’s Madelaine I’ve gotten ahold of Vanessa’s phone and think i should be active on her Twitter since I’m never active on my own
I been on Twitter a lot lately lol
Lol don’t believe everything you see on Twitter 😂🤦🏽‍♂️
There should be a hand signal for “yes I’m walking to my car in this full parking lot but I want to sit and look at twitter and relax for a minute when I get there so please don’t follow me”
Imagine how much better Twitter would be if it were only open on weekdays from 9-5
Number of years since being founded:   IBM: 108 years Disney: 96 years Microsoft: 44 years Apple: 43 years Amazon: 25 years Netflix: 22 years Google: 21 years Alibaba: 20 years Tesla: 16 years Facebook: 15 years Twitter: 13 years Airbnb: 11 years Uber: 10 years Snapchat: 8 years
there could be infinite universes with infinite possibility’s of reality and we got lucky enough to have twitter 😌
in 9th grade an anonymous kid made a LukeKorns hate twitter and using my vast stalker skills I figured out who it was & confronted him at school. he was so shocked i figured him out. i was like 4 foot 11 and i made this dude intimidated the only time in my life ive achieved this
For my birthday, Molly--aka the Thing of Evil--gave me a new shirt. She suggested I wear it today. She further suggested she might tear my throat out if I did not post a picture of it on Twitter. I must do her bidding.
I know liberal Twitter reacts with outrage no matter what.   But this isn’t accidentally typing “covfefe” or hate-tweeting Chrissy Teigen.  This is abusing the power of the Presidency to force a foreign government to interfere with our elections.   This is huge and impeachable.
Eyes on the prize.  Return to the rule of law and accountability.  Return to the dignity and gravitas of the highest office.  Return to a day when Twitter wasn’t a tool for governance and alliterative nicknames, but a social media method to see what Ariana Grande is up to.
Dear Twitter,  I was taking out the trash earlier and walked directly into a massive spiderweb.  Spotted the huge spider but it was way too high up on the house to kill it.  It saw me. I destroyed its home. Now it will try to come after me. I’m terrified.  Pray for me, Uncle Jack
lol  producer: the twitter fans seem upset with you today?  us: no that’s just...*heavy sigh*...how they show their love
Twitter 2019 be like ...  Tweet : Heart goes out to all those victims & family members in that horrible tragedy.  Replies :  15 Kpop fancams , 6 spongebob memes , 4 clown emojis & a “SHUT UP BOOMER”
My good friend and #MAGA patriot, Ann Vandersteel appears to have been permanently suspended from Twitter. She was given no warnings or explanations.  When she appealed she was told you cannot appeal "multiple violations." She has never been warned of ANY violations.  This is BS.
Twitter > Instagram
You claim you get bullied on Twitter.    You chose the day a couple announced that they were having a kid to remind them not to let this one drown    How can one human being be so callous, wicked and insensitive
Judging by my twitter feed it seems like people think there are other things in politics that matter tonight besides the possibility that the President of the United States asked a foreign nation to ruin his political opponent and then cut off their foreign aid when they refused.
The #Patriots have released WR Antonio Brown, as he indicated on Twitter. They have moved on.
A lot of people on Twitter today assuming children only learn in classrooms.
Appears attempt to revive Kavanaugh war mostly fizzled. Twitter frenzy a week ago, but NYT did book authors no favors. Serious problem: If you wanted anti-Kavanaugh red meat, book didn't deliver. Biggest news actually supported other side. Energy quickly faded.
Always make an entrance
How does the president know that the whistleblower's complaint is "highly partisan," as he claimed on Twitter without evidence this morning?
So far in my Twitter feed I see majority of black & brown ppl saying the makeup was insulting, but that JT's apologized & actively done better things for POC than other PMs from recent memory. They have perspective. White ppl however...
At least one signatory of that letter defended a popular twitter user after he called me a “negro bedwench,” arguing basically that I had brought it on myself by writing about the role of class in racial coalition building. It’s disappointing to say the least.
How could Trump possibly know whether the whistleblower is “highly partisan” as he says on Twitter this morning? If DOJ or IC shared that info with him, which would kill any future whistleblowing.  Either he knows the identity of the whistleblower or he is pretending to.
Lampard round-up:  - Mount could face Liverpool with late fitness test (as reported) - Kante is fit but not match fit in Frank's opinion - Twitter need to make clear action on racism - Spoke to CHO as soon as he joined to get him to sign (as reported) - Klopp respect #CFC
There was a time when being an activist brought with it the slight inconvenience of being, well, you know, active. Now, thanks to the magic of Twitter, you don’t have to leave your home, or even get dressed. Progress marches on.
Football authorities have met Twitter in London on Friday to discuss what can be done about the racist abuse of players on the social media platform.
I just woke up and my trending topics were Lisa Bonet, Rudy Giuliani and Phil Hartman so I guess it really is still 1994 and all of that was a terrible nightmare although who invented Twitter while I was sleeping?
Ms Mehbooba Mufti, former Chief Minister J&K to whom this twitter handle belongs has been detained since 5th August 2019 without access to the account. This handle is now operated by myself, Iltija daughter of Ms Mufti with due authorisation.
been on twitter way too much gonna give it a few minutes
only reason I actually miss deadmau5 on twitter is because he is a professional asshole he somehow added a strange balance to the world. I do kinda miss that even tho at times I was caught in the middle prob best he doesn’t tweet anymore on here but it was pretty great sometimes
When will the @JoeBiden, @KamalaHarris, @PeteButtigieg & @BetoORourke campaigns be asked to condemn the racist bullying and harassment their supporters on Donut Twitter routinely direct at Nina Turner and Briahna Joy Gray?
twitter should be an olympic sport
My wholehearted thanks to @TwitterIndia for upholding the constitutional right "Freedom of Expression" by  unsuspending all the @Janasenaparty followers twitter accounts and for the timely swift response.
“so I actually follow you on Twitter” remains the most terrifying sentence to hear midway through a date
Twitter Verified....😁
i remember when twitter launched, my mum was trying to grasp the whole concept of it and she said:  “so twitter is like: you fart and then you tell everyone that you farted?”  I think about this often
Been gloriously, almost completely off Twitter this week. But this Kash Daniel thing is pretty simple: It looks like he A) did, in fact, try to hurt the Florida QB’s ankle and B) concocted a righteously indignant tall tale about it. Stoops should sit him. Just can’t do that.
Y’all really just be sitting on twitter figuring out new ways to disrespect, degrade and try to put women against each other...   Aren’t you tried?
that jawline tho...
Look up!
This place is like 90% careerist nerds trying to be funny by copying "weird twitter" joke formats from 2013 and 10% journalists tweeting at brands about a flight delay but somehow is literally where Western Discourse is taking place now, very cool shit
My @Twitter Q&A starts NOW!!  #AskDana
Positive speech... Touched politics  Criticised #BannerKillings  Responsible speech #subasree Stood up for fans Shut down twitter trolls #ThalapathyVijay  uses the audio launch mic best. #BigilAudioLaunch
Dear Twitter Friends     I just wanna to let everyone know      It’s raining pretty hard to where am at in Sugar Land   Am at home safe       My message to all my Twitter friends     Pray for us 🙏❤️
Yooo @Twitter ...I’m baccckk 😎😎 catching up on all the tweets I missed the past few months. Thankful for all the luv n support 🙏🏿
To be sure you don't miss our upcoming stories, we recommend having notifications turned ON for @Project_Veritas, @PVeritas_Action, and @JamesOKeefeIII. We exposed firsthand the games Big Tech companies like @Twitter play in #shadowbanning content they don't like.   Stay tuned...

If @Dev_Fadnavis government announces lottery scheme for subsidised MHADA plots in AAREY, same twitter activists will be the first people to find connections/jugaad to Fadnavis and bribe officers to get a plot. #Hypocrisy
Thank you for all of the supportive messages and to those encouraging me to go after those who have smeared my name in the press and on Twitter – but I’ve had enough of court cases. It has been three and a half years and I’m bloody knackered.
Question for Ravens Twitter. There has been a lot of debating going on when it comes to Joe and Lamar. Why do you have to tear down one to pick up the other? Why can’t you be thankful for what Joe did but welcome the new era?
You may or may not think the anger over the treatment of Omar Salem is justified. But the anger is authentic. Media commentators have to understand that, and stop treating these episodes as twitter mobs orchestrated by sinister puppetmasters, located presumably in Labour HQ.
Dear followers and fans time to have another #AskLala session on Twitter? Please join me from 10pm to 10:30pm PST to night. Look forward to hearing from you. :)
Ok after much debating I think it’s a national feeling that #LauraKuenssberg didn’t just report the news for the BBC she and OTHER journalists deliberately pointed out the father of a sick child’s voting record and twitter account and directed their followers to pile on him
One of my favourite things about Twitter is complete strangers genuinely believing that you owe them a personal explanation for your tweet - and getting cross if you don’t give them one
If I change my Twitter handle to "Wayward Rainbow," that's like the teacher dancing at the prom, right? 🤔
If twitter ban me then twitter is over.
I might start using my Twitter like early 2000s AIM all I really wanna do on here is post Fall Out Boy lyrics anyway
"@Bakkt" is our only official Twitter handle - we want you to stay safe and avoid scams!   Bakkt will never use social media to: • Request sensitive information • Give away bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency • Publish a wallet address for deposits
there is no construct on twitter i hate more than "stand by for news." when ya got the news, post the news!
twitter is great because the guys with very proper pictures as avatars and bios like “the last bastion of reason in a wasteland of desire” are always arguing with guys with avatars of Pikachu with a joint who just called them a dork.
The twitter left have gone beyond doolally today with their apparent intention to conceal the fact that the guy who shouted at Boris today is a prolific labour activist.  If you think that’s not a relevant fact to report you’re absolutely off the wall.
Dear Mr. Kozak:  The US, although net exporter of fuels, is a large net importer of crude oil. The US civilian and military economy cannot continue to depend on crude oil imports from the Eastern Hemisphere (Persian Gulf / Middle East). It must ally with Canada and Venezuela.
Dear Mr. Kozak:  The US has in Venezuela a problem of national and hemispheric security, guerrillas, drug trafficking, terrorism, humanitarian crisis, and spread of socialism. But, you also have there the opportunity to recover a historical ally, your main supplier during WWII.
Dear Mr. Kozak:  Then that same 90% of the Venezuelan military that would not repel a foreign military intervention would work together with foreign troops and professional police to dismantle groups, thugs, and guerrillas.
Dear Twitter Friends, I love the people in King County. I love the locations in King County. We had a perfect place to shoot Twin Peaks and perfect people to work with. Both Dow Constantine and Kate Becker are great! All-in-all it made shooting Twin Peaks there a dream.
I loved how the Australian News Anchors were blown away with the concept of Twitter Philanthropy
People all over the world are watching Twitter Philanthropy! Exciting times, Team!
Twitter Philanthropy allows us to use technology to see immediate needs ... and in many cases, immediately take care of them!  ❤️🇺🇸👍
Me: Everyone should learn math  Me: Also, statistics is the most practical math for people to learn  Everyone on Twitter: I just ran 1,000,000 regressions and found [totally crazy thing]  Me: Oh God I take it back
Cause our music must grow outside our country.  Le duletse go botsa batho marete mo Twitter. Tsek

My Twitter life is such a delicate tightrope. On the one hand I want to be positive and bring people together and on the other hand I want to scream NIGEL FARAGE IS A WANKER twenty-seven times a day.
I don’t understand the reason for suspending 400 twitter accounts of Janasena supporters.The reason behind the suspension of these accounts ; just for  standing by helpless people and their issues? And how do we understand this?#BringBackJSPSocialMedia

Twitter friends: give a follow to the newest conservative member of Congress from North Carolina: @RepGregMurphy!
Any other angry middle-aged white dudes out there on Twitter by any chance? Asking for a friend.
Liberal zealots:  Let's see, we've ruined education, we've ruined advertising, we've ruined Twitter, we've ruined the Oscars ... I KNOW!  LET'S RUIN COMEDY!
i think when you develop a positive relationship wit twitter where you really just accept it for what it is  it’s the funniest best shit of all time 😭
brain: anonymous neo-nazi on twitter dot com doesn't like you me: okay brain: i must suspend the serotonin me: wait why brain: jus gotta
Your snarky “just teasing you!” friendly Twitter insult directed at someone you barely know has approximately a 99% chance of being received as an actual insult.
This morning I had magically “unfollowed” my husband, according to Twitter.    It happens to me a lot that people tell me I have unfollowed them when I haven’t.
Consider this my official #Twitter request 2 b part of federal election debates. If they r giving national soap box to @MaximeBernier hatred racism sexism and poisonous vitriol then should be "balanced" w native perspectives re social justice and earth justice #invitepamtodebates
Lord Keen vs Lord Pannick. Is there some kind of rule that they all have to have names weaponised for Twitter gags?
The Sun’s Twitter account currently has 1.5 million followers. Wouldn’t it be great if #BoycottTheSun could help reduce that to 1 million. Or less. Hit ‘em where it hurts. Check your ‘Following’ list, y’all...
Just enjoyed a really nice short break with my loved ones.   Back on Twitter today to catch up & I’m blown away by how vicious so many folk are on here...   Chill out people. Stop hating on those with other views to you.   Life is too short, seriously. Focus on being happy...
guy attacks my sister on twitter and I defend her... then he blocks me  lil softcock
I have been unable thank individual well wishers on my birthday. But I am taking to twitter to express my deep gratitude for the avalanche of good wishes. I hope to live upto your expectation
Yep, that’s me. Author of such triggering controversies on twitter as:   “Not all games should have easy modes.”   And  “Gamers were bullied in the 80’s.”  These statements get hundreds of nasty-grams. But there are thousands more who agree with me.  Are you not entertained?
on twitter, you either die young or live long enough to condescendingly explain The Wire to David Simon
I stayed at Warren’s event for about an hour after she finished. Then went home, watched the Browns game, showered, caught up on emails, ordered some new dresses, hopped on Twitter to find Warren’s selfie line is still going!
“This didn’t age well” twitter has to be top 1 worst twitter. A video of Trevor Siemian mic’d Up didn’t age well because he got hurt? What does that even mean?
Sitting at my office (restaurant where I do work bc getting anything done at home w/ babies is impossible) & woman named Kelly, whom I've never met, approached me & said she follows me on Twitter & is praying everyday for Nusayba. People have tremendous capacity for kindness.
turning a corner. Tapping into the real comedy/podcast base that has been destroying them as a reliable source of comedy for the last decade. But no. SNL fears the twitter thumbs of the garbage humans that want to take jobs away from actual funny people while living in their....
Coming on Twitter daily to have fun and be serious makes me happy. I really don’t talk much in real life, I am shy too. So I’m only expressive and comfortable here.
Hey @Jack,  My publisher is still getting promoted tweets for The Vagina Bible with the word “vagina” refused or accepted then removed 3 days later by @twitter.  White supremacists are ok, but the vagina is profane? This is a problem.   You know where to find me.  Jen
You know it's real when it's in the header
The U.S. Supreme Court has made a lot of bad decisions throughout our nation’s history. Some of its  worst decisions are in death penalty cases. Over the coming weeks and months, I’d like to have a conversation with you here on Twitter about some of these #SupremelyBad cases.
Dear Twitter  Friends   Special Olympics Golf Tournament ❤️  I took 2nd place   I did my best   We play 9 hole   I score 57   I will continue to lose more weight   I be working out when I get home   Thank you everyone for y’all cheering for me ❤️
Imagine you could harness all the stress and pain that’s caused by anonymous twitter accounts who have 30 followers and a football player in the profile pic, and then turn that into clean renewable energy?
Today is the day on twitter where everyone realizes Soulja Boy unfollowed them
Retweet if you remember when we had a president that actually did his job instead of ranting like a loonatic and attacking people on twitter.
Dear Twitter,  You deserve to have a great week. Go out there and crush it. Ask that person you like on a date. Put that extra time in at the gym. Celebrate life with friends. Buy that new game you wanted for yourself.  Im rooting for you.  With Love, Uncle Jack
Me: 𝐎𝐎𝐎𝐎𝐎𝐎𝐇 𝐘𝐄𝐀𝐇!!!   Library Twitter: Shhhhhhhh   Me: ᵒʰ ʸᵉᵃʰ
Dear @Twitter @TwitterIndia kindly take action on this account @AliSohrab007 who is disrespecting a woman & defaming her. Hopefully it would be against to your community standard.
AS A PREDICATE TWITTER FELON I JUST BREATHE DEEP HUG MY KIDS AND DONT ENGAGE WITH HUMAN ZIPLOCS FULL OF COTTAGE CHEESE AND MAYO WITH BABY CARROTS FOR DICKS.
Failing to write a book? Write an article. Failing to write an article? Write a Twitter thread.  Scared of starting a company? Build a weekend project first.  Stuck? Lower the stakes.
Summary of what the New York Times pulled this weekend:  HEADLINE: KAVANAUGH ASSAULTED ANOTHER WOMAN  **watches story trend on twitter**  **watches story headline news for 24 hours**  quiet update: she actually never recalls being assaulted and declined interview ...oopsie🤷‍♂️
Twitter Philanthropy (you) bought four (4) teachers’ classrooms supplies this weekend. That is 4 less teachers that have to worry about not having school supplies! Amazing. This is what social media should be used for! GOOD! ❤️🇺🇸👍 #TwitterPhilanthropy @People_Giveaway
I feel like my parents read my twitter and are like   ??????????????????????????
Sigh. @Twitter is at it again...removing people who have followed me. Silencing me because I have the incorrect view are you @jack? 💁🏾‍♀️
Small update: H3CZ has changed his twitter to just @H3CZ now.
Cancel culture, social justice warriors, twitter mafia, outrage mobs, PC culture, hysteria ... and tomorrow there will be a new term, to broadly delegitimize the basic act of people speaking up, rather than engaging with actual cases and arguments
I could have googled it, but I love getting my tea straight from the source: gay twitter
If you ever need a laugh, Twitter is guaranteed to have something for you 😂😭
A guy on the Bus Stop just yelled at me “Jay Z’s got more money that you!!” as I drove by...  I though that kinda shit only happens on Twitter! Lol
I forgot what twitter is like when the Cowboys aren't dominating. Missed y'all 😂
Twitter is not real life.
Be careful of people pretending to be my “family members” on twitter. As far as I know, no one in my family is doing any giving away on twitter. Also, I will never ask you to send money to my personal accounts. I am unaffiliated with 3rd parties. Be Smart! Love All! ❤️
1/ Too many people, including way too many people in the media, discuss Trump as though the things he says on Twitter are his "beliefs," when we know from his thousands of public lies that they are not. *Always* read a Trump tweet as though it's the lies of a sociopath. *Always*.
I very regularly see people on Twitter hardcore praising movies I found to be totally without merit and ya know what? I love that. It's a thing called individual taste and it's a beautiful thing. How awful and boring it would be if we all loved and hated all the same things.
So, I had to fire my Buddhism teacher & block her on Twitter because she was secretly creepin on my tweets, phoned me while I was at a VIP celebrity campout upset that I called Jeffrey Epstein a motherfucker on the Internet. My life is a series of McSweeneys essay rough drafts

1m on Twitter. Aren't you guys the nicest? you are. you are and i love you #simiarmy 👅
More than 800 days have passed but SSC CGL results haven't been declared yet. Students are suffering and Twitter handle of @DrJitendraSingh is blocking anyone who is pointing this out. I request Minister sir to kindly look into this. #RequestCGL17Result
twitter at 3am is just better 🤷‍♀️
I said “Marlians come forward the rest fuck off” and u still played the song to d end and u wanna come on twitter to chat sh!t. I said b!tch in a song? So fucking what b!tch? #PXTA out now
all is well :) I am happier than ever before. I’m still single. I am also still in deep love with coco but it’s okay. Anyways. Being back on twitter is cool. I got new music coming and I hit 1,000,000 followers on IG today and that’s scary to me
I lost about 300 shitty fucking followers tonight which is fine because I will gain 600 wonderful people tomorrow...  It’s the circle of Twitter.  And thank you to those who stuck around. I know it’s because I offer free Priority shipping in the US.
There is an actual person behind the decision to write and tweet “having a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm room party may seem like harmless fun” from a New York Times twitter account and that person should probably not have a job at the New York Times
Shaun King gave his Twitter account to his wife to fight with Deray? I —
Retweet this tweet to see this tweet on your twitter when you tweet.
I love when “journalists” claim to be dealing with wrath of angry podcast fans. Then be a real journalist and write about the Koch family, the CIA, embed yourself in a war zone, etc...I’m sure all those will be less stressful than having someone on Twitter call you ugly.
I thought gender neutral pronouns were a load of crap at first but I have friends who go by ‘they’ now and it’s no big deal. Brexit. Twitter. Prorogue. We didn’t use any of these words ten years ago. Language evolves stop being a dick it costs exactly nothing to respect @samsmith
A month ago, I was publicly shaming @CameronFriscia on Twitter for watching lacrosse instead of paying attention to me. The league saw it, hit him up, & gave him sideline passes. Now I have to go to not one but TWO games tonight ALL BC OF MY OWN DAMN MOUTH 🤦🏼‍♀️
Twitter allows the introvert in me, to talk to people without ACTAULLY talking to people.
There are countless types of annoying people on twitter.  Endless, really.  But the ones that annoy me the most at the moment are the ones who police your likes and dialogue with human beings on the either side of the political aisle and call you out for them.
Yesterday Twitter was a stream of insults and today it's a stream of excellent book recommendations. This creature reacts very differently depending on where you poke it.
Libra: Booked a facial, blocked & unblocked a few people, made tea for the aesthetics, read Lacan, read Kylie Jenner’s twitter, suppressed 938 emotions, thought about living alone forever but lmao you’re all so boring what would you do without me, anyway, what’d you do   Friend:

We brought GOOD to social media with Twitter Philanthropy.  We also brought GOOD to legal system by hiring best lawyer for Baby to get LifeSaving Drug.  We are starting 'Philanthropy Suits' where we will pursue those who hurt us helping others. Winnings will go to People in Need.
Twitter, please acknowledge that I challenged a guy for an hour in the airport who said “climate change was a hoax to control people” and “Mayor Pete is the catcher not the pitcher obviously” and he still bought me a beer at the end because DIALOGUE IS POSSIBLE.
Im waiting for all the guys who took potshots at @DarrenDreger over Marner numbers in last 2 weeks to say “geez Dregs, you were right”... including some in media on twitter...easy to critique, quiet as a mouse when they’re wrong
Getting off Twitter for the weekend. I dare 25 of you fine souls to join me in the real world? Each week will try to increase the number. Who’s in? Comment below and let’s reconvene on Monday!
Me: “Hey! Light-hearted joke!”  Twitter: Are you high? Are you ok? Are you high? What’s wrong with you? Are you high?
DeepFake Videos are going to lead to some amazing LED micro jewelry with random patterns/sequences  worn during live broadcasts as proof of reality. We might even have decoder software in viewing devices confirming it's real. Think Twitter/FB authentication codes .
Our world is so distorted & upside down when pop star Sam Smith, with an eye on promotion, trends on Twitter after he declares himself they/them...but a genuine, real-life, Shero died today & she doesn’t. Her name was Magdalen Berns and no amount of they/thems could match her.
TX Rep. @BriscoeCain says no FBI calls or visits, he’s temporarily suspended from Twitter, and says law enforcement currently with his wife and kids due to credible threats. He says his remark was reference to TX’s famous “Come and Take it” motto. #DanaRadio  (Audio forthcoming.)
Few people have been as wrong on foreign policy over the last few years as the neocons and @Liz_Cheney.  The Twitter exchange represents a real and significant debate on the future of our foreign policy between realists like myself and #NeverTrumper neoconservatives like Cheney.
People wonder if it's wise for me to insult Trump on Twitter, given my work as a curatorial journalist. But it was that work—and years of legal practice—that confirmed for me that Trump is a treacherous criminal who endangers us all and who we have a *moral imperative* to oppose.
When you post a clip of a foul-mouthed person being obnoxious to a polite one, people tend to sympathise with the polite one. Odd that so many people on Twitter think it’s clever to post clips of people being rude to Boris.
Twitter has taught me that people don't know how to read.
I would really like to meet Pewdiepie one day. We have changed Twitter into something positive. Maybe we can do that for YouTube too? @pewdiepie @MrBeastYT
Everyone in my Twitter timeline and mentions:  🧐 “HARD SKIP. No reason to upgrade from a recent iPhone to iPhone 11 or Pro.”  🧐 “iPhone 11, non-Pro, is the one to get.”  Also everyone:  😎 “JUST DITCHED XS FOR iPHONE 11 PRO MAX! OMG BETTER SHIP BY SEP 20 OR SO MAD!”  Human-ing!
I have officially abandoned my campaign to have Twitter change its “Who to Follow” section to the grammatically correct “Whom to Follow” due to lack of interest.
Which is the bigger Twitter warning sign - “blocked by” in the bio, or an F1 car as the avatar? Very finely balanced. Think it’s fair to say that if they’ve got both, they’ve killed. And will again.
One question: Will twitter actually explode or shut down when Jackson wins or hows that gonna work? #BB21
gonna be a banner day when you discover your husband's twitter account
man wtf im in a uber w no headphones and im scrolling on twitter then click a normal lookin video to hear sum fuckin moaning wtf bruh prolly think im weird
someone sent us a post that was like “I think the percy jackson musical twitter’s only special interest is...getting people to come see their show?”  and WHEW. it sure has been tough to hold that in for almost three years, but you caught us and we’re glad it’s out in the open now

Let’s do a Twitter Poll:
Who wants to watch politics when you can fill your heart and mind with the love and kindness of Twitter Philanthropy?
hi twitter thanks for the career
the goodest dogs
Twitter, I’ll remind use again, I’m not streaming whilst playing this with no minimap. On the verge of flipping this setup.
Oh man for a second I was like “oh Jesus Christ what’s twitter offended by now” then I watched it and was like oh my, this actually offends me
Friendly reminder that APCON has NO right and NO POWER to regulate any social media advert because no social media companies exist in Nigeria.  A website’s location is limited to where its servers exist.  There are no Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram servers in Nigeria.
I’ve said it before and I say it again. We NEED a verification system on social media where people HAVE to use their own identities. This will stop children who are too young being on social media and also stop fake accounts @Twitter make this happen you have a responsibility
OF COURSE Katie Hopkins tweeted something vile about Jesy. She’s a professional troll who shouldn’t be allowed a Twitter account. #OddOneOut
Twitter just suspended Gary Franchi's @NextNewsNet.  Why? @TwitterSupport
I read Twitter, I don’t just post thoughts; I’ve noticed some folks use the ploy “RT if you agree!” which annoys me.  If folks like what you Tweet, they’ll share it. Every time I see one of those I think:  YOU CAN’T TELL ME WHAT TO DO YOU’RE NOT MY REAL DAD.

Why am I giving away all of this money? Because my wife and I want to give to people in need, and Twitter Philanthropy is amazing.  We will not be swayed by haters.  We will continue to Give!  I have not profited off of this! In fact, it COST me more than $100K CASH! Beautiful!❤️
I’ve seen about 20 articles on my twitter feed about the harmful affects of vaping.   Less than 10 people have died from it.   Almost a half million Americans die from cigarette smoking every year. No articles on that astounding statistic.
Idea: Twitter gradually increases character length of tweets so that by 2030 we are reading books again
Doc Sindi is one of the best people to ever happen to South African Twitter. She’s done incredibly well at sharing accurate medical information, as well as debunking dangerous medical myths. She’s also managed to create an online medical network of doctors who share further info.
Really feel for women who were breastfeeding in olden times. When they got up in the middle of the night, there was no twitter, so they had to wander miles and miles through the dark clutching their babies to ask their neighbors to say one short hot take on each other’s cows.
I can’t believe I came back to twitter for this bull shit
I’m tired of talking about it just as much you are tired of reading it.   But I’d hate to see your talented child’s big break followed by a twitter moment:   Celebrity parent “found dead.”   ...all because an affluent lifestyle was worth the sworn blood sacrifice to false idols.
Hypocrisy:  Alyssa Milano spends her career attacking gun owners on Twitter  She wants to stop law abiding gun owners from owning firearms  Yet she admitted that she herself owns two guns for self defense  This is the Democrat mindset:  Rights for me but not for thee
Thank you God for giving me my health, family, friends, and my Twitter Family.  Amen.
1 like = Twitter Philanthropy makes you happy😀
Liberals on twitter who have been defending Trudeau up to now are like frogs in boiling water, who didn't notice the temperature was going up one degree at a time until it reached the boiling point ...
*6 people die from illegally tampered vapes*  trump: BAN VAPES!  *thousands of people die from legally purchased guns*   trump: enough is ENOUGH! i am so tired of seeing this! time to block chrissy teigan on twitter. ahh that feel nice. oh a shooting. oh noo dang hm wat we gon do
I’ve been loving my twitter family lately ♥️ you all make me feel loved.
I am looking for two Analyst/Associates to join our VC team at Draper Associates. Bitcoin, crypto, digital healthcare, or data tech education or experience preferred. DM me @timdraper on Twitter.
Dear young, aspiring journalists: Doing the job well is not the same thing as the internet adoring you.  Do not think that validation on the outrage and meme factory that is Twitter = job well done, or vice versa.
Great news today. #Bills DT Kyle Peko's wife, who was with stage 3 Hodgkin’s lymphoma back in June, shares on Twitter that she is now Cancer free.
It is with a heavy heart that we mark the somber anniversary of the day we learned that Ted Cruz jerks it to twitter porn
Knock knock @INCIndia Anybody there? Kab tak aap log Twitter par hi virodh karoge? 🤔
He’s back! Alex Andreou @sturdyAlex shall be taking over our Twitter feed again today.
Congratulations to PM @NarendraModi ji for crossing 50 million followers on Twitter. Your leadership has inspired people from across the globe to connect with you and follow your work. The nation is proud to have a leader like you.
"Saudi Arabia Threatening Canada With Another 9/11 On Twitter" Vs. "A Woman Who Looks Like Ted Cruz's Wife Walking In On Her Stepdaughter And Boyfriend Doing It"
thank god for twitter. all my useless thoughts would go unpublished
Here’s the twitter handle and bio of every Trump supporter who messages me:  🛑🛑 MRS. HUBBY❌ 🔕🦴 @ lillian29894 CHRISTIAN PATRIOT!! Iam Pro-Gun Pro-Teeth and I EAT BEES! Any one from cast of GUIDING LIGHT 💡🚫 will be BLOCKED! TRUMP ~IS~ YOUR president @BradleyWhitford! 🅱️🅾️🅾️
Congratulations to PM @narendramodi for crossing the 50 million mark on @Twitter. A trendsetter in the digital space, he has used the platform most creatively to give rise to social movements and make governance more participative.
Twitter is a place for non-famous comedians 😂 everybody on here funny asf
hey you fucking fucks I am back on twitter for today after 9 months. Suck my peepee
When you step away from Twitter, do you feel the love of this feed pulling you back in?  I do.
Just incredible: the Mexican govt basically got Trump to endorse its view of the migration deal (big success) over that of his own advisors (Mexico needs to do more) by presenting him with a flattering chart — which the president then posted to Twitter as if it were a US govt doc
I just realized I lost 40k followers on twitter because I stood up for my brother Ye politically last year. I never felt more empowered and I will do it again cause twitter is not the real world
i just found out about the passing of @JarridWilson, who took his own life.   As someone who battles anxiety and depression, his posts always encouraged me and i enjoyed chatting with him and his audience on Twitter.  Please join me in praying for his wife and family.
Trump spent the other night attacking John & Chrissy. It didn’t go well. If we could trick him into dissing Beyoncé & Taylor Swift one night I swear their fans could get him to quit Twitter in 24 hours.

Congratulations to Hon'ble PM @narendramodi Sir for crossing 50 million followers on Twitter.  It's a proud movement for us 140 Crore Bharatiya.
The ungraceful exits of Trump National Security Advisers: 1) Flynn -- fired after lying about Russia and facing jail time 2) McMaster -- fired while watching successor visit White House to audition for his job 3) Bolton -- fired while disputing on Twitter that he was fired.
hey twitter
“Oh you were a senior Trump official?  Which one?”  “The one he fired on Twitter”  “You’re going to need to be more specific.”  “His disgraced national security adviser.”  “Oh—the warmonger with a mustache or the felon who got paid directly by the Kremlin’s propaganda machine?”
Although their eagerness to humiliate themselves on Twitter afterwards is also fascinating.
He fired you. Update your Twitter bio. Get some therapy.
Mustache mad man takes to twitter to say trump was too chicken shit to fire him to his face. Amazing.
#BREAKING: President Trump has announced on Twitter that he has fired National Security Advisor John Bolton.   The announcement comes as Bolton was reported to have urged Trump to not negotiate with the Taliban.
I love scrolling through my own likes on twitter it’s like my timeline but finely curated to only things I find appealing
No other state's police seem to be as active and prompt on Twitter as UP police. Even small police stations in UP have verified handles and they almost always respond to queries
I was watching @mykeemae ‘s “Reading My Twitter Drafts” hahahahah GUSTO NIYO BA MEDYO SCARY TO PERO ANO HAHAHAHA
Dear Twitter Friends    As a Special Olympics Athletes   My weight loss progress   I lost 38 pound ❤️
I'm going to make up an extremely offensive slur for humans  its an inclusive slur for all Humans  Garplespij  'gar-pul-spij'  I have now declared this to be offensive so twitter will have to ban anyone who calls someone else a garplespij
What did humorless scolds do before Twitter?
Thank you @TwitterIndia for verifying my handle. Proud to be the first CAPF officer to have a verified twitter account. Jai Hind  🇮🇳
Twitter after hours....🔥🔥
The new twitter recommendation algorithm means that just replying to an account boosts their profile. When someone is being an ass, ask yourself if telling them they're an ass is worth being their PR agent for free.
2. Valerie Plame's former colleagues at CIA have been pretty vocal on Twitter today that her launch spot trivializes the work they do and turns it into a James Bond ad rather than conducting serious/important clandestine operations and offering critical analysis to policymakers.
Putting lettuce and tomatoes on a cheeseburger should be banned.  Sleeping with socks on should be illegal.  Have a good week, Twitter friends.
I wish I could have been there when someone told him, "so John Legend and Chrissy Teigen got #PresidentPussyAssBitch to trend on twitter..."
A little announcement: As you know, Twitter is an unrelenting nightmare that’s destroying all of our brains. After some serious reflection, I’ve made the tough decision to take a break from caring about my brain. See you in 2 minutes, assholes!!
September 9, 2019: On this day in American history, #PresidentPussyAssBitch trended on Twitter.
Today in Trump:  1) Report that CIA pulled spy from Russia because it distrusted POTUS  2) Twitter cancellation of fantasy summit with Taliban   3) $17.2 million to subsidize Scottish airport essential to Trump golf resort   4) Twitter 4-parter about African American ingratitude
Trump’s sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump run the Trump family business while daddy plays golf with the Taliban to celebrate 9/11 or goes off on Twitter all day. Don’t pretend like the corrupt Trumps don’t talk to each other all day and haven’t planned this. They have.
Everyone asked me “did you forget your Twitter password?” Or “are you kind of a lazy type of person??” .... Ok.. my answer is “BOTH” 🤭
6) And at that moment, he decided: They would not refuse him - he would refuse them! He would show the Taliban who was boss! He found his excuse in the latest in an unceasing series of Taliban atrocities. He took to Twitter to announce "YOU'RE FIRED" - just like the old days
I am totally #FilthyMouthedWife #TeamChrissy if just for the fact that she managed to get #ppab, #PABOTUS, #PresidentPAB trending on Twitter because it won't allow the full blown #PussyAssBitchPresident to trend.  @johnlegend , you married well. #JohnLegend #ChrissyTeigen #Monday
How to study effectively: 👨‍🏫👩‍🏫  Step 1: Enable Zen Mode. Step 2: Study. Step 3: Try to open Twitter. Step 4: Fail. Step 5: Actually study.
attacking Chrissy Teigen is the closest twitter equivalent to invading Russia in winter
Starting a twitter war with @chrissyteigen is pretty much all the proof I need that this dude has lost his marbles. (Inviting the Taliban over was a close second)
Everyone is so fucking pc now it’s so annoying can we go back to Twitter about 4-5 years ago when no one on here was pussy lol
The president has gotten away with a lot of stuff but I truly believe he will regret starting shit with Chrissy Teigen on twitter
.@twitter won't let Twitter be great. I understand.  #PresidentPussyAssBitch is vile and absolutely should not trend.
Trump got totally unhinged that a Category 5 hurricane didn’t hit Alabama, wanted to invite the Taliban to play golf with him to celebrate 9/11, and now picks a fight with Chrissy Teigen on Twitter. Whatever Trump is really hiding to distract us with all this stuff must be huge.
my favorite meme account is my twitter likes
It is about time that Twitter be used to communicate (and solve?) the needs of the poor and vulnerable. Let’s rid social media of the hate and vitriol. And replace it with love, kindness, and generosity! ❤️🇺🇸👍
Let’s make this tweet Twitter’s biggest chat room. Go:
There's a site that tells you which work of literature your Twitter feed is longer than, and mine is longer than Les Miserables, which is really interesting because my very first tweet was "Stole some bread, now this dude keeps following me"
I don’t know how  #SelfiesForScrofano started or why, but I’m super happy that I got on Twitter today. You have such wonderful hearts and I’m so lucky to have you ❤️😭❤️😭😭❤️😭❤️❤️
Wait... so is the new Twitter gimmick to give away money 'randomly' for follows and rts?  I'm not going to do that... So unfortunately for everyone I'll just keep trying to earn follows and rts by sharing my opinion and attempting to be creative. 🤷‍♂️
I deadass got two fan base.They all over my twitter and IG ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Do men tell other men how to use their twitter account or do they only do that to women?
As I’ve said many times, this is my Twitter account, and I will never ask you for your bank information. I also will never ask you to send money to my personal accounts. Be careful out there folks! ❤️ There are a lot of fake accounts etc. Got to be smart! Love you all!
Twitter is like,   “Hey, guys. After 15 years of effort I’m finally releasing my life’s work. I’m so proud of it and hope you like it” ✨4 likes, 3 retweets✨  “Good thing manatees are in water cuz they look like they’d have a smelly ass” ✨124,729 likes, 78,987 retweets✨
Twitter told me some Fortnite Twitters on the list i submitted did break the rules & would stay suspended.  The innocent ones wont be freed up till Monday.
Doesn't seem odd that whoever is taken all these Fortnite twitters down seem to be going after Fortnite "NEWS" channels ...... almost every fortnite news twitter got hit except -->   "Fortnite Guy"  hmmmmmmm  I DO NOT TRUST THAT KID - JS
Can you imagine how different our political landscape would look if Twitter would simply shut down all Russian bots?
Cowboys Fans this is my simple reminder to you as we embark on the new season. My twitter account is not a place for you to bitch about how the team is playing I have nothing to do with the play calls or decisions that are made. I promise that there will be a time/place for that
A simple apology and twitter would’ve forgotten Pallava Bagla in few days but Nidhi and Prannoy jumped to his defence and attacking ‘trolls’. Now those ‘trolls’ are revealing things that make the situation much worse for Pallava.
After offensive and racist tweets from Gemma O’Doherty we have decided to block and report her to @Twitter. We are proud of our multicultural & diverse team and our customers. We are proud to work with, and serve, each and every one of them. Everyone is welcome in our store.
Friends, why drag the Paki troll minister to Indian twitter over #Chandrayan2? It’s got to do nothing with Pakistan. Why make him feel so important? Let them burn in hellhole. मुँह का स्वाद मत बिगाड़ो यार 🙏 #VikramLanderFound
Twitter, please help!   We will be issuing further proceedings on Tuesday to compel Boris Johnson to adhere to the law in the so-called Benn Act. We want to put before the Court all the evidence that he plans not to. 1/2
Just been informed by @seriousfunnyguy that he had completed the task of illuminating all 120 houses with solar power and provided 11 Solar Street lights too. This was entirely his project and he collected around 14 lacs from Twitter people.  More power to you. You are #IAmBuddha
Why isn’t Juicy Smollett’ey trending on twitter? (just curious)
hey @Twitter why do so many people not get my notifications when they have them turned on??
Taliban at Camp David was never going to happen but glad you announced it on twitter.
You can be terminated from YouTube, Twitter, Facebook etc at any time, for any reason, sometimes no reason.  Yet that's now 18 times I've posted my balls on my Snapchat story and I STILL have not been banned.
There are days when Twitter feels like a fast food drive thru. “I’d like a Gallowglass book, two stories about the twins, and a milkshake.” This is one of those days. 🤣 Happily creativity is not a burger and fries. You can’t just order it. You get what you get when it’s done. ♥️
"Ditching credit cards for facial recognition will remove the last physical barrier between our bodies and Corporate America."  Sorry Winston, your payment has been declined because that edgy Twitter post reduced your social credit score below the threshold.  No food for you.
I created my Twitter account the day that President Obama was re-elected,  telling myself “You can sit at home & complain, or do something about it.”  I want to thank President Obama for inspiring me to help defeat Hillary Clinton.
I love Giving to others so I’m going to give priceless information away today to random people. Here goes:   Whenever someone promises free stuff on @Twitter in exchange for your profile information you should flee from them.    #TwitterPhilanthropy is fake! @RyanAFournier @pulte
For those wondering, the twitter handle @kailasavadivoo is fake, and does not belong to the @ISRO chief K. Sivan.
Here are South Africa's 2019 Social Media Stats;  (1) Facebook - 21 million users (2) YouTube - 9 million subscribers  (3) Twitter - 8.3 million (4)  LinkedIn - 6.8 million (5) Instagram - 6.6 million  #SocialMediaTraining
On my way to the Twitter Blue Room...Should be there in sometime... Dabangg3 shoot wrapped a bit late n,, traffic... So frnzz,,,, hope excused 🤗🤗🙏🏼
Twitter if some of you are going to get mad when I mention that my books are not *categorized by publishing* as YA and then other people are going to get mad when I add that all books can be books for teens I don't know what you want me to say. Read what you love.
The Indians have lost contact with their lunar spacecraft. It sounds like failure and they will be quite despondent right now. Their Twitter will savage their govt about wasting money that should have been spent on Education. But they will try again  and will succeed one day.
STOP talking trash about social media platforms   Snapchat is for REAL FRIENDS  Instagram is BEAUTIFUL  TikTok is SILLY FUN  Twitter is for REAL TIME  Pinterest is for INSPIRATION   Facebook is   LinkedIn is your RESUME
Mike Tomlin’s Twitter “drafts” folder must be filled with gold.
THANK YOU for the 2 MILLION love on Twitter❤️ it’s been an informative and entertaining platform to be on...promise to tweet more often. Thank you to all my lovely fans who shower me with all this love on Twitter. Love you. #2million
Every post about Antonio Brown I see on Twitter makes me more grateful to cover a class act, a true professional and a true leader like #GoBucs WR @MikeEvans13_ – not some clown caught up in ego and drama he creates for himself.
The daily bashing of Prince Harry & Megan is now becoming tiresome!  They’re a young family & should actually just be left alone!   Let them live THEIR life. No one here on twitter knows what’s it’s like to be THEM!   NO ONE!!!!!!   SO LEAVE THEM ALONE!!!!
i don’t have a personal twitter. that’s why when i get crazed about people covering up jeffrey epstein’s death, i use the bands twitter. cause whatever. on a brighter note, our new disco-y tune #PickuUp is out now🕺
This Week at Twitter Philanthropy ✅$1K+ for a teammates daughter's-funeral  ✅$1K+ to a homeless family ✅$5k+ to a teammate with cancer  ✅$575 to a police officer for medical treatment bill ✅$8K+ to help a Vet with a car  ✅$4K to family of hit and run victim
I just submitted over 10 Fortnite twitters that were suspended to Twitter to restore.   I guess I’m going to try to help everyone.   If you been suspended in last 48 respond to this tweet with the suspended Twitter @ & what happened!
My therapist never has anything useful to say whenever I talk about how toxic twitter is for my mental health. He has less than 500 followers and begs me to retweet. Absolutely pathetic.
Never thought I’d have to try to be active on Twitter but here we are...will actively be responding to you lot starting tomorrow. Right now, it’s a well deserved and stupidly early sleep for me. Goodnight, God bless.
Hey just a heads up because a shocking amount of people are surprised I said something lewd once:  I don't consider myself 100% kid-friendly anymore.   On YouTube: "Hell"/"Ass"/"Damn" are online. You can hear these words in PG movies all the time  Twitter/Twitch: anything goes
Why have we used Square’s CashApp or PayPal? Why not Checks?  Easy!  No, that's the answer. They're easily accessible to Americans already online. I'm not an investor in either.  Not every1 has a bank account and when I give away my money, I want every1 on Twitter to have a shot!
So Twitter today is debating which is worse, cracker vs. nigger. And debating the merit of HBCU’s.   I’m going to checkout for the weekend.
3. (Quick note to trolls: Sorry, but I didn't lose my job. I left ThinkProgress over a year ago.)  ThinkProgress started before the HuffingtonPost, before the DailyBeast, before Twitter, before Facebook  And it had a big impact
T-Mobile was amazing to partner with for Twitter Philanthropy. MyPillow was also great. Recipients to be announced soon. We gave away some money using PayPal today. And tomorrow, thanks to Square’s CashApp, we will be giving away more money! Momentum! Thanks to all companies!

I’ve sent letters to each of @facebook @twitter and @google on behalf of not just our campaign - but every campaign who has been left to contend on our own against disinformation. This isn’t our job to clean up: it’s theirs.
There is a method to get people’s twitters suspended. But it only works on NON verfied twitters. They been doing this for years.   Last night they got @HYPEX & today they got @DolanDark ..   Someone at Twitter needs to fix this.
Dear @Twitter, Delhi police has registered FIR against @Shehla_Rashid for doing fake tweets against Indian Army.  Earlier also Dehradun Police registered FIR against her for same offence. She is regular offender of tweeting fake news.  Kindly suspend her account. @TwitterIndia
Been reading a lot of things on here (it's always on Twitter) about the narrative of The Joker movie being problematic and might inspire people to go down that route in life, if this is the case, wouldn't that make all movies problematic? It's getting harder for filmmakers
Twitter is really superior to IG.
@ArvindKejriwal Ji, your spokespersons asked me as per your desire, with the full arrogance that the Party will accept My resgination even on the Twitter. So pls Kindly accept My resgination from the primary membership of the "Aam Aadmi Party", which is now a "Khas Aadmi Party".
Would geniunly appreciate it if you shared my new song on your Twitter/Instagram or just texted it to 1 friend who hasn’t heard my music. Thank you 💙
I don’t know if people are aware of this, but it is possible to disagree with someone’s opinion on Twitter and not tell them.
At the end of the day, men like David Brooks and Bret Stephens are bugging out about Twitter and online discourse because suddenly their voices aren't the loudest in the room. How dare we think we're just as important.
Every Dem candidate must agree that they will delete their personal Twitter account on the day of their inauguration if elected and will not use Twitter expect for official WH announcements during their presidency. We need a fucking break. And the country needs a real leader.
Someone start a twitter account of disappointed fans during a football game.
When did the claim “insuring less people means more people will die” become controversial? Or divisive? Get some awareness. prioritize people’s lives over your hurt feelings on Twitter or your hatred of a certain candidate & the people who work for him...
Every day at Twitter Philanthropy, I feel like we’ve won the Super Bowl! Seeing the looks on the faces of Americans whose lives we are changing. Makes all of the hard work worth it! Thank you Team! ❤️👍🇺🇸
.@jack - Can you please require each user to pass a basic test relating to the use of "your" vs. "you're" before gaining access to Twitter?  Sincerely,  America
Call of Duty Mobile now has its own Twitter: @PlayCODMobile

Does @realDonaldTrump really not have anything better to do all day than rant on Twitter about whether Dorian was projected to hit Alabama?
Trump scoured Twitter to find any tweets that supported his crackpot prediction the hurricane would hit Alabama. And now he’s spreading needless fear and panic that Hurricane Dorian poses a threat to Alabama, which it currently does not.
So Nicki Minaj has retired.... Cardi about to get a whole lot of new stans..... they’re already changing their twitter pics & bios as we speak 😂
what if beyonce is following you on her secret twitter account
also... im back. i have an obsessive relationship with you guys. felt weird and disconnected to not be on here for almost a week. but with that being said, @JessieJabber thank you with all of my heart for monitoring my twitter for me while ive been taking a break 🧡💓
Hello Twitter, how is your pickems?
She and I agreed it's for the best that I don't wade into the whithertoes and the whyfores - I'm not really here for discourse atm. I'm concerned about my friend who (get your barf bags ready sincerity incoming) I care about very deeply. But! She's fine. Just sick of Twitter.
I know there are a lot of people concerned about Natalie - I woke up to several people asking me about her, and for those out there who are worried, she's okay. No one "made" her leave Twitter, it was a choice she made for her own reasons, and may or may not be permanent.
I played my ass off for the purple and gold. Played hurt and never had an excuse. I’m truly grateful to the Lakers organization and I do understand the NBA is a business. But as a player you just want the courtesy of a phone call saying I got traded and not finding out on Twitter
hugs!
Dear Twitter,  YOU LOOK GOOD!!!  With Love, Uncle Jack
When I had hair, I went to the barbershop weekly for 20 years. Men talk about sports, women, work, politics, and music in there. It's a safe space for Black men to bond in a hostile world.   Twitter weaklings are selling outsiders false narratives. 💈✊🏿
I vastly prefer when Bret Stephens uses his column to relitigate his petty Twitter grudges, as opposed to today, when he's using it to help Netanyahu make the case for bombing Iran
I’m ok #bbcqt tonight! Twitter has been full of witty lines about the days news. What have been your faves so far? Mine has been the one about most people leave politics to spend more time with their families not less 😂
As Hurricane Dorian has strengthened back to a Category 3 and works its way up the southeastern U.S. coast, the president continues attacking Debra Messing on Twitter.
It is sad to see people deteriorate like this, yelling at Twitter for days with increasing absurdity to cover-up an otherwise trivial mistake, except when the person still has sole power to launch our nuclear arsenal, then it is fucking terrifying.
idk why tf that was tweeted on my twitter i don’t need money do y’all need some money?
For y’all:   I’ve gotten DMs from various people, marveling at how well we’ve done developing a Twitter feed.  “What’s your secret?” I’ve been asked so often that it’s an inside joke at home.  I seem to have connected with the most active, passionate, fed-up bunch: thank you all!
It’s not just annoying and time consuming to deal with trolls and bots it’s also dangerous for our country. For every free country. @jack @Twitter clean up your site.
Hey @DevinNunes if you feel like venting anger or making a rhetorical point, that’s what Twitter is for. Now please stop clogging up the dockets of real courts with your frivolous, self-pitying garbage lawsuits.
Important message as we enter the next Bitcoin bull market:  - BTC is very volatile - You can lose all of your money - Only invest what is ok to lose - Twitter is not investment advice - Don't buy BTC with credit cards - Keep low time preference - Do your own research  🙏🏽🙏🏽
Notice how @realDonaldTrump hasnt tweeted or said anything about my boy @AndrewYang that’s because he’s genuinely frightened of him.  Yang would absolutely demolish him in a debate   Come at me political twitter

It’s hard to talk BB on the podcast/twitter. I’ve come out of my seasons to past HGs judging me and just being pissed that I’m a female and I won. It wasn’t a good look...for them. & I never want to make someone feel how they made me feel.
Well, folks  Just wanted to say it's been the time of my life getting to know you these past 7 years but Twitter just isn't the same place it used to be   So long for now
Can I shock you? I’m not a fan of dark mode Twitter
Debra Messing, whose controversial comments about black people caused #RacistDebraMessing to trend on twitter,
The year is 4057.  You open Twitter.  Scarlett Johansson and Kevin Hart are trending.
Some PERSONAL NEWS TWITTER: After five years here at BuzzFeed News, working with more terrific editors and colleagues than could be contained in a single tweet, I'm headed to @vulture where I'll be starting as a film critic later this month.
hi twitter i spent 3 years hiding in trauma fugue state i am out of it as of today, i am very talented and funny i am ready for money and love ty
VCs in real life: hello  VCs on Twitter: success is a raft made out of tears. obstacles are lovers in disguise. a startup is a wish your heart makes
I hope everyone who has been complaining about a lack of “democracy” &  a “coup” will take to twitter and urge the Labour Party to vote for a general election tonight.
The BBC Politics Twitter account is run by a Tory, pass it on
You're in charge. If there are real problems at the FBI, you can work to fix them. That you vent on Twitter rather than doing actual work says much more about you than it does about the brave men & women of the FBI who put themselves in harm's way to protect us.
Kevin Hart really thought he could rattle Lil Nas X, a veteran of Barb twitter
Me: I like oranges.  Twitter: I had a bad orange once in 1997, so you're wrong. Me: I didn't say every orange that's ever been was amazing.  Twitter: It was really dry.  Me: I didn't say, "You like oranges." I said, "I like oranges." Twitter: Did you even think about my orange?
If there were ever proof that Twitter isn’t real life, I’ve seen more tweets complaining about Jacob Rees-Mogg stupidly lying down on Commons benches than I’ve seen complaining about MPs trying to overturn the democratic vote for Brexit.   Priorities, people, priorities.
All the Corbyn centrist critics are mysteriously absent on Twitter today - how about a bit of praise (or even humility?)
I’m done with Twitter. We are not doing anything here but arguing. I’m reaching out to leaders who can do something now. If you wanna help me help my people, then Let me know.
Artists are busy fighting on Twitter when we are the ones more powerful than politicians in mobilizing the people to stop and find other ways to address ALL these problems!!!! PEOPLE ARE DYING NOW!!! BOTH SIDES!!!!!
Damn. I’ve had an anxious pit in my stomach since I woke up this morning and I’ve been back on Twitter for one day and I don’t think that’s a coincidence.
I be on Twitter once in a blue Moon..
Finna put a sneaky nut in India I’ll be back twitter
“Looking tall looking tall. my god! Looking just like ya mama. We’re so proud of you” - me and the rest of Twitter showing up at your kids HS graduation bc we’ve watched them grow up on here via photos
Who ever knew giving away my money on Twitter would be so popular?
If you wish to be my friend, on Twitter or in life, don't tell me to get a thicker skin. Don't tell me not to be so sensitive. And when I say what's bothering me, don't debate me about why it shouldn't. People have been pulling these tricks my entire life and I'm done with them.
A year ago today, @lizzo had 60,000 followers on Twitter and 247k followers on Instagram    Today, she's got the number one song in the country, 870,000 followers on Twitter, and 4.6 million followers on Instagram.   And she's just getting started! 😭
The responsibility for stopping misinformation cannot be on the victims of misinformation attacks. It has to be on the tech companies who allow right wing operatives to spread misinformation. So I’m looking at you @Twitter @Google @facebook. What are you going to do about it?
As a campaign, we’re almost entirely powerless to stop misinformation. We can tweet corrections, but only a fragment of the people exposed will see it. This rests on Twitter,  Facebook, and Google who let this go completely unchecked.

My Twitter analytics says I have ___________ views in last 30 days. How many views do you think I have?
Thank you so much @pmdfoster for your brilliant journalism yesterday, the article you wrote  and insights you shared on Twitter were hugely valuable to me as I made my decision

Imma just get off Twitter now before I take yall back to the Old me.
We need to recruit people to Twitter
I took a picture of Adam Vinatieri and posted it to twitter.. in the background was a damn near naked Andrew Luck...   Andrew Luck could’ve had me fired ON THE SPOT. He didn’t.  #ThankYouAndrewLuck
I'd be honored to have you follow my bid to become the next Chairman of the Republican Party of Texas by following me on our campaign Twitter feed  @West4Texas .  Steadfast and Loyal! #HTHTN #Texas #TuesdayThoughts #TexasGOP Pls RT!
Dear Twitter Friends   As a Special Olympics Athletes   My weight loss progress   I lost 36 pound ❤️
Twitter is the strangest place. People I know to be decent, kind, thoughtful folk in the ‘real world’ just become point-scoring, opinionated, unkind and thoughtless on here. Depressingly there’s plenty of them, doing it regularly.
Woke up this morning to Tony Allen trending alongside ‘Justin Bieber admits to heavy drug use’ and ‘man robs Popeyes at gunpoint over chicken sanchwich.’  It’s amazing Twitter is free.
Hello from South Bend! Welcome to the new, official Twitter home for @PeteButtigieg’s presidential campaign. We’ll share stories from the road, Pete’s latest policy plans, and breaking campaign news.  #PhaseThree is here. Are you ready?
You can block anyone on Twitter at any time for any reason. I do and am proud of it. You’re under no obligation to listen to anyone on a platform you’re not being paid to use which you use recreationally. Yes I only want to hear from people who are polite to me? Problem?
twitter got me out here thinking im a comedian for using reaction pics
Twitter friends — can I ask you a favor?  One of my dear friends just gave birth to a baby suffering from health complications. Please say a prayer for them?  I know it’ll make a difference. Thank you. ❤️
there should be a silver bird mailed to you when you hit 100k on twitter like the silver play button
Pray for the trolls on twitter. They are hurting.
How to be a celeb in nigeria, Share money on IG and twitter

Are you a Twitter Philanthropist?
Hey twitter world- tomorrow we have conspiracy theory debunker extraordinaire @MickWest coming to the podcast! If there are any conspiracies you'd like us to ask him about so he can throw cold water on them, let us know!
One of you noticed my number of Twitter followers has been frozen, and when you followed me as a new follower the number didn't change. Yes, I checked, and the number has been frozen since Aug. 11. This happens from time to time. I can't explain it.
he was a skater boy she said see ya later boy he wasn't good enough for her  now he's pretty big on twitter and every few months she scrolls by new pictures of his bare ass on the timeline with captions like "it really be like that"
Many people are opening twitter accounts because they want in on Twitter Philanthropy. Thank@you to the team for bringing people all over to give love and generosity
Saw a filmmaker whose work I love siting and refreshing their Twitter notifications after a tweeting a just-okay joke and took comfort in the fact that everybody, literally everybody, is a loser
twitter won’t let me tweet the same thing twice... wtf
‘joker’ but it’s a woman on twitter and men yell at her online every day until she becomes radicalized and writes a thinkpiece for VICE instead of executing a bunch of people
twitter dot com makes me want to buy a cabin in the middle of the forest where the internet doesn’t exist and disappear forever
we had a dream of playing football for state but after an unfortunate accident we were forced to hang up our cleats and become a sentient diner twitter account
Dear Twitter,  Can you all say a prayer for my friend?  Ain’t nothin’ wrong with him. He just likes pineapple on pizza. So sad.  Thank you, Uncle Jack
Every time Trump attacked me on twitter, lied about me, and sent his thugs after me, I was in danger.  I had to move from my apartment in NYC to another one, had to have protection when walking around NYC.
Never thought I would see a day where Pak army is protesting on street against India and our sanghi boys are hunting Pakistani ministers in Twitter DMs.😂
I’m flying on private planes a lot less these days because I want to give away more money to people in need on Twitter
“Wrong answers only” is the worst Twitter joke. It takes the “it’s funny because it’s two things” ethos to its nadir.
US GDP growth rate=2% since 2010, BitTorrent's daily new downloads=260-280k, my Twitter handle's daily new followers=4-6k.  W/o any intervention, growths follow the same pattern.  Don't focus on boring info, $TRX & $BTT huge campaign next week TBA!
Conservative white woman jumps in my mentions, spews racist & sexually suggestive stereotypical vitriol, gets rhetorically & intellectually obliterated and dragged, plays the victim, complains to Twitter, blocks, complains to followers that twitter didn’t suspend me.  Repeat.
Not only should we consider impeaching you just for being a whiny bitch on twitter but we should deport every stupid fuckface who still supports you.
Guys i changed my Twitter name because i wanted to switch it up for Fall 😂 rest assured Brent and i are good as ever 🌈❤️
I thought some lunatic also hacked Trump’s twitter and posted nonsensical, racist things.  Then I realized that it was just a normal day on his Twitter.
Me: I think I’m going to bed   Wife: why is #Philanthropist trending on Twitter  Me: Ha, funny  Wife: no seriously, look at what your teammates did while we were watching the movie  Me: Holy crap, we’re trending!
Thank you Team! #Philanthropist is trending as #3 on Twitter. Wouldn’t it be a shame if we got it to #1 Trending!
Anyone here have a good dad joke for this rain delay?   We have one: What’s Forrest Gump’s Twitter password?   1forrest1
Wow how did Joe Walsh hack Jack Dorsey’s twitter account
Just a reminder to followers who are tweaked by the stuff I post on Twitter. I have great news for you! Following me is entirely voluntary. There’s a nice, shiny, almost candy-like unfollow button in the upper right there that will solve all your ills. Click it early and often.
After seven LONG years on the waitlist, I am finally joining this fantasy football league... as their first female team owner, it’s important that my team name is 🤟🏻👊🏻🙌🏻👍🏻 do me proud, Twitter!
If you want to win at fantasy football, quick takes on Twitter aren't going to get it done. Listen, learn, react, adjust.  We're paid to provide our best guess the moment things happen, but you'll be darn sure I'll be changing my opinion with new information, insight, or context.
There is a Category 5 hurricane about to hit the Bahamas and then Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas yet the President of the United States is busy tagging American citizens on Twitter to target his massive online mobs to bully them. What a disgrace and a deep shame.
Aaah I will try to be more active on Twitter too. sorry guys ❤️🙏🏻
PLEASE NOTE: I've realized that many Kenyans on @Twitter and @facebook are functionally illiterate and cannot understand what I wrote. Let me try to translate it in much simpler terms: RUTO AND MIGUNA ARE LIKE OIL AND WATER THAT CANNOT MIX, therefore, they cannot work together.
i just went on daytime mode after using twitter of color for a week and i get it now. that daytime shit is garish and ugly
BAN ALL KPOP TWITTER ACCOUNTS NOW!!!!  They are killing society!
Remember when Trump accused 80% of American Jews of being disloyal to Israel because they vote Democrat? That was just 11 days ago. Remember when he lied about a China call? Earlier this week at G-7. Remember when he shared classified intelligence on Twitter? That was yesterday.
“whoever runs the lightning thief twitter is online a lot.”  yeah it’s...that’s...what happens when the internet is your job...
Chai! I’ve spent all day today lying in bed, gisting with you people on Twitter. I’ve resisted all pressures to do any work. Just eating my daughter’s cooking, drinking good wine,  eating chocolate and trolling you people. I’ll take a break from you people for a few days. Bye.
This Carlos Hyde trade makes me think Bill O’Brien just read twitter for suggestions on how to add help for his backfield.
Just hit a million followers for the second time.   Shortly after the first time, twitter cleaned out the Russian bots & I lost a bunch of followers and most of the accounts liking my jokes. I assume it’s the same this time too.  I wish my wife supported me the way the bots do.
Dear Twitter,  I hope you have a truly fantastic day. You deserve it. Order your favorite food, get under a blanket, and watch your favorite movie.  Also, we should put our Minecraft beds together. There...I said it.  With Love, Uncle Jack
We were discussing, only yesterday, how utterly mega Anthoine had been in F2 this year and how we couldn’t wait to see him mount a title challenge in 2020. He was so fast. So talented. And so nice. Whenever he came on the Twitter show, he was a joy. A humble, lovely lad.
the most cursed twitter bio i’ve ever seen was “Atheism. Video games. Buckeye football.” still think about that guy sometimes
THANKS 92NEWS: I will have the privilege to write an Urdu Op-Ed column in Daily 92News every Friday. My writings on Twitter will also continue. I thank the 92News for this opportunity.
My future employers are gonna be so interested in my twitter account   Stream Euphoria
Why do @jack &  @Twitter think it is okay to orchestrate abusive trends like   #گل_بخاری_کنجری against a respectable Pakistani woman columnist by secret service bots and fake accounts? 🤔🤔🤔🙄@TwitterSupport
my twitter is still not loading... jungkooks impact
[Trump puts kids in concentration camps]  BRET STEPHENS: using the term “concentration camps” is a wild overreaction  [Bret Stephens gets mildly owned on twitter]  BRET STEPHENS: i have been holocausted
To recap:  1. Bret Stephens searched his name on Twitter. 2. Found tweet of a professor referencing him as a bedbug. 3. Emailed the professor's provost (his boss) about it 4. After backlash, goes on MSNBC, refuses to apologize, blames Twitter 5. Compares his plight to Holocaust
Every time I read some dumbass American blogger write "I am literally fighting for my life" on Twitter, I think of these kids in Hong Kong.
If there's anything which brings home how utterly unrepresentative Twitter is of the general population it's the endless fixation people have with NYTimes columnists
Letting a columnist equate someone who called him a bedbug on twitter to Nazis is quite an editorial choice.
That Bret Stephens column that not-so-subtly references Dave Karpf should be retracted. It knowingly slanders Karpf in the Paper of Record, likening a mild Twitter insult to the stuff of Nazis, and all because he got his feelings hurt. Children shouldn’t have @nytimes columns.
I've had Twitter kick the shit out of me. It sucks. But when you're lucky enough to have a great media gig, you accept that taking incoming heat is part of the job. You don't narc on critics. You don't use your privileged perch to compare yourself to Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto.
God damnit, twitter! #RIP45 is trending and I was about to call the caterer.  I’ll say it again: when that miserable fucker dies, I am throwing a block party. 🎉
Young people today are snowflakes. Unrelatedly, someone calling me a bug on Twitter is Kristallnacht
Bret Stephens just published a NYT column in which he likens being called a "bedbug" on Twitter to the political conditions of 1930s Germany. There is something seriously wrong with this guy
what the heck I just logged onto twitter and saw all of u guys posting cute #thankyoujames messages 😭 thank YOU for watching my videos  making me smile on my worst days, and for saving my life ily so much
The folks who hacked the CEO of Twitter should’ve just remained quiet & started working on getting into Sallie Mae, Fafsa, Freddie Mac & Wells Fargo - deleting all student loans, home loans & auto loans! BUT NOOO they had to prove they’re tech savvy IDIOTS 🤷🏾‍♀️
If Jack Dorsey can be hacked, someone could hack President Trump’s account, threaten nuclear war with Russia and China, and our adversaries may believe it and act upon it because it’s not necessarily out of character for Trump to announce a nuclear first strike on Twitter. Yikes.
ME: lol isn't it kind of weird that a 39-year old jerry seinfeld at the height of his success dated a high school student?   GUY ON TWITTER ABSOLUTELY TELLING ON HIMSELF: yea but was it ILLEGAL????? didn't think so checkmate snowflake
Jack experiencing firsthand a microcosm of Twitter's harassment and Nazi problem is for no reason making me think of how he only banned Alex Jones until immediately after Jones yelled at him in person.
Jack filed a report and got an email back saying there were no violations of the Twitter Rules.
If the CEO of Twitter can get his account hacked, we're all 100% screwed
After a horrifying 20 minutes of n-words and actual Nazi propaganda being pushed from the CEO's hacked account, maybe Twitter will take the gamification of harassment and racism as seriously as its victims have been for years.
People have told us that they decided not to commit suicide because of Twitter Philanthropy. This is the power of kindness, love, and generosity in this Community.
Twitter security saw Jack’s account posting racial slurs and was like “we still need more evidence he was hacked”
The fact that #JackGotHacked shows what a garbage platform Twitter is.
To review our Friday so far:  Someone using the President's Twitter handle posted a smartphone picture of Top Secret reconnaissance photos and the CEO of Twitter had his account hacked by someone who then posted racist, pro-Nazi messages.
Just imagine the head of Twitter's security team right now, on seven different kinds of mushrooms, nude, in a giant bamboo steampunk rocketship called the Love Temple, ignoring his push notifications
Dear U.S. Generals: Please do not tell Trump anything else you are up to unless you want Trump to take to Twitter like this and brag about US covert intel operations. Trump must be putting lives of undercover US operatives in Iran in risk!
You act like we're not also listening to NFR
I've decided to suspend my membership of Twitter from tomorrow till the end of October. This will be a moment of great national significance and I don't want my mind befuddled by undue praise (as if), exaggerated abuse or the echoing of my own thoughts and preconceptions.
On #Kashmir: 1. India’s heavy-handed actions, including shutting down the Internet, have created a PR disaster. 2. That anyone who points this out on Twitter faces abuse makes India look even worse. 3. Anyone who thinks public opinion does not affect US policy is a clueless rube.
I have deleted my tweet about the hurricane &  Mar a Lago and sincerely apologize to all it offended. It was intended as sarcasm-not a serious wish of harm. Throwaway lines get a life of their own on Twitter. I shd know better. Mea culpa.
Dude so many male comedians on twitter trying to start a ~destroy PC~ revolution. Comedians above most others should know there are bigger battles to fight... but man, I’ve never seen a group of people so pissed off that there are societal guidelines about being shitty to others
Reddit is always a good place to go when Twitter isn’t dark enough for you
On this date August 30 in 2017, I was blocked on Twitter by @realDonaldTrump. He unblocked me per court order on August 28, 2018. #FirstAmendment
Free 'repentant' Boko Haram   Negotiate with bandits   Request 'respect’ for herdsmen'  Pay Kidnappers  Make criminals ministers  Hero worship Abacha  Ask @Twitter to block critics  jail activists  Declare IPOB/Shiites terrorists  Use EFCC on opposition  Who am I?   #RenosDarts
Y’all HEAVY on that forgiving shit unless it’s Chris Brown.  Him and Rihanna have long since moved on but Karen sitting alone on Twitter in her basement apartment with her 35 cats hasn’t.
Automatically blocking people with “light skin” in their bios or twitter names >>>
When I’m not on Twitter next week just know im sitting in a house with no power or cellular and kids yelling because there is no WiFi and trees falling around me.
Positive twitter day... means let’s try to be polite & civil 2 each other regardless of our personal views. Abuse shouldn’t be on any platform. Hope the sun shines & it’s a a good day where ever you are in the world today #PositiveTwitterDay
Lana Del Rey just dropped her album we eating tonight Zoloft Twitter

Thank You @Twitter @TwitterSports @TwitterPH for the badge 🤘🏻
OK, Twitter. There's still time. Keep up your calls to Ministers Dutton and Coleman #letthemstay #hometobilo
Okay, off twitter for the night.   Warren 2020.
I got a lot of pictures of phalluses sent to me on Twitter when I was still 17.   And the really confusing part was the intent- some did it as harassment and some expected a date out of it.   Please encourage your children not to use social media.
Update: Alex Trebek is taping new episodes of "Jeopardy!"   In a video posted on Twitter, the game show host says he's completed chemotherapy for stage 4 pancreatic cancer and is "on the mend."
Never been able to tweet this before, since Twitter didn't exist last time.  New Tool album tomorrow 🤘
So sick of all the anti-Biden, anti-Bernie, etc shit I read all over Twitter by other Democrats.  You can be pro-someone without being anti-someone else.  The goal is to get that orange fuckblob out of office. If you don’t understand that, then get out of the fucking way.
Sometimes, people have an irrational fear or being ratio’ed on Twitter. Who cares? If you stand by what you believe in, it doesn’t matter if the mob doesn’t like it. Continue standing up for your own voice and don’t let others bully you into silence.    Proudly be you.   Always.
Besides all the clout seeking trolls, Twitter has the kindest people ever, don’t be scared to ask for help on here.
Twitter done gave ya girl an emoji ! #megantheestallion
Twitter, it's my birthday on Sunday, and the only gift I want is this:   If you're able, please grab a copy of a LGBTQ book - I don't care if it's mine or someone else's - and donate it to a person or an organization that could use it.
Your reminder that Twitter won’t autoban Neo-Nazis because their platforms align with GOP politicians.  This is why we must do it ourselves, and crowdsource reporting and blocking:   Twitter is enabling the Fourth Reich.
The PROOF that James Comey is a dirty cop. The IG Report just verified that he was caught leaking, lying, violating FBI rules, violating DOJ policy, violating his employment agreement,and he’s on Twitter bragging he wasn’t indicted. That’s a dirty cop. #Comeyreport
In 2017, Twitter permanently banned a user for making a death threat against a mosquito.
When you’re old and on your deathbed, are you gonna think back at all the “likes” you got on twitter or ig?? Go out and make real memories that you can say “fuck yeah... I’ve lived. I’ve loved. Ive accomplished that. “
I'm loving all the requests for cosplay, you guys, but I've never done it before and it's an ordeal.  I have to commission a costume, bug @MaureenAPrice to shoot it, get over myself, etc. I maybe can make it a goal for some kind of huge milestone, like 50k Twitter followers?
If the Joker was real he would have worst Twitter account
Why haven't people realised by now not to mess with Liverpool twitter? A skip in your garden is the *best* case scenario
I am being shadow banned again by the @Twitter.   Many friends are saying in DM that they don’t see my tweets on their TL.  RTs are also decreased. @TwitterIndia
I have a feeling I am being shadow banned again by the Izlamic Republic of @Twitter. Many people have DMd saying they don’t see my tweets on their TL. Do RT if you see this.
if it’s “just a joke” & everyone needs to “calm down” why are you searching twitter to pick fights w strangers that didn’t like the joke? either it’s “just a joke” & EVERYONE needs to calm down (including you) or we admit that saying harmful shit isn’t negated bc you’re *joking*
Thank you 6 Lakh twitter Family
Dear @Twitter , I don’t know why you placed a restriction on @AishaYesufu ‘s account but if Twitter represents what I think it does, people like Aisha must not have their voices restricted by systems we have come to trust to help democratise power and activism. Lift the gate!
When the apocalypse comes and most of our bodies are sucked into fire pits and the ocean drowns those who remain— I think twitter will be down for at least a day.
To all student newsrooms — regardless of how cute and quirky you all are on Twitter — if your leadership structure is mostly white and clique-y, cut it out. Open things up and welcome first-gen students and students whose families don’t have a journalism legacy. (1/2)
Laughing at the twitter trend of typing “I’m marrying an ______” letting it auto fill 😂  ...here’s mine:  I’m marrying an email
Twitter in a nutshell: "That was wrong of you to say. You should apologize." Person: "You're right. My apologizes. I made a mistake." Twitter: "THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. MISTAKES ARE NOT AN OPTION. YOU SHOULD LOSE YOUR JOB, YOUR FRIENDS, AND YOUR RIGHT TO EXIST IN SOCIETY."
In case there’s PANIC! AT THE TWITTER DISCO…  One guy jumping the gun on a big story does not magically erase Trump’s long history of laundering money for the Russian mob…nor does it change Pelosi’s slow-burn impeachment calculus one iota.
“No one cares what you think” “@“ responded the guy who follows me on Twitter.
#SupaFriends ‼️ I’m doing a Twitter Q&A at 6:30pm ET. Tweet with the hashtag #AskMissy and I’m going to answer y’all 🤗 #AskMissy
The overlap between “I don’t wash my chicken” twitter and “i don’t wash my legs” Twitter is exactly why “I don’t wash my chicken” Twitter can’t be trusted
Next time I’ll just do a Twitter q&a
I know Twitter is cesspool but I want to share one more good story. I just received an email from a donor who was going to fly from Canada this week on her own dime to get tested for my daughter's liver. She follows me on Twitter & just wanted to help. Don't lose faith in people.
Yup that's it!
you are right
Imagine having 2 updates back to back and get trending on twitter for revert and you still don’t revert
there are two types of journalists on twitter. one is the kind that gets excited to defend Breitbart after they get ejected from a presser by saying “sir. ALL news is the news.” and the other type gets fooled by obvious fakeposts from r/relationships
anyone have complete list of NYT reporters today rushing onto Twitter to defend Breitbart? it's a pretty long list....
long movies forever.   you're reading this on twitter — stop pretending like you were gonna do anything productive with that extra time anyway.
Startling how many people on Twitter today never expected Johnson to sink this low. Only those of us who've had the great misfortune to have known him are unsurprised.
John Major prorogued Parliament in 1997. I don’t remember anyone saying a thing on Twitter. #Hypocrites
You blocked me on Twitter for saying Miracle Whip had a higher approval rating than you. A judge had to order you to unblock me.  So maybe you should slow down on being tough, fuckface.
“The infestation of bedbugs at The New York Times office” @OANN  was perhaps brought in by lightweight journalist Bret Stephens, a Conservative who does anything that his bosses at the paper tell him to do! He is now quitting Twitter after being called a “bedbug.” Tough guy!
I know, I know. My Twitter is not an accurate reflection of the public or the media. But a lot of people on it who are usually quite distant from the Brexit debate are livid about what's happened today.
Thank you everyone on twitter for following my handle. Just a few days back it has touched 3k. Thank you for this tremendous rise.
Imagine being on Twitter and having the worst thing you’re called in a given day is “bedbug.” My own friends roast me harder than that 😂
Twitter Today: Snowflake melted over being called “bedbug”. #PresidentLoco ranted re bedbugs & many other things. Being a fit young man working for Falwell pays well. Storm’s heading to 🇵🇷. Trump lies re aid. A little boy saved the day by being kind to an autistic classmate.
Just to recap Trump's latest overseas jaunt:   --He spent most of the time on Twitter  --Attacked the free press   --Skipped the climate change mtg   --Repeated Putin's talking points   What an national embarrassment.
why do fast food restaurants keep fighting on twitter lol
damn y’all I’m in twitter jail brb
You've been browsing Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit threads long enough to know the secret you're looking for doesn't exist.  Get to work!
thank fUCK twitter didn't exist in the 90's cuz otherwise every woman who tweeted "riot grrl" would get @'ed by some verified dude with 4k followers like "hey there! just letting u know you misspelled the word 'girl'. Your avi looks gorgeous btw!"
Me on twitter: I have a thought I’d like to share.   Men: Here’s a thread on how your thought could have been better.
This week, the IDF opened @Twitter, @Instagram & @Telegram accounts in Farsi.   The people of Iran deserve to hear the truth and that’s exactly what we will share.   Iranians can follow @IDFFarsi to see for themselves that they are not the enemy, the oppressive Iranian regime is.
Our societal inability to say vagina like we say elbow is one reason I insisted on VAGINA in the title.  When we're not allowed to say a word the implication is it's dirty or shameful. Not being able to buy an ad because of the word vagina for a book about vaginas is ridiculous.
I've never been called anything as quaint as a bedbug on here but one time a man time traveled to present day twitter to call me a harlot and it made my week.
Couldn't be us
Imagine if all the writers of color who get called vermin on Twitter got to go on TV news about it
there is no joke funnier than the actual situation of finding a tweet with zero engagement calling you a bedbug, trying to get someone fired over it, then waking up to "BretBug" trending on Twitter the next day
Since announcing my campaign for state Senate, my tweet impressions have dropped substantially. Yes, I’m a Republican, but I’m trying to bring everyone together. That would be easier if I wasn’t being silenced on my largest platform. @jack @Twitter
The president seems to be politicizing Tropical Storm Dorian on Twitter as it nears Puerto Rico.
Are we Golden Twitter
50% of columnists now are polished front row kids who played by all the rules, went to the right schools, learned how to properly couch their rightwing bile then twitter happed & random rose emojis told them to suck on a tailpipe and their columns are now just them melting down
I don’t care that Bret Stephens left Twitter because he’s a hypocritical twinkie.  I do care that the @NYTimes continues to publish his garbage climate science denialism.
This is your reminder that you should not play devils advocate on Twitter. The devil can afford to pay you. Doing it for free demonstrates bad labor solidarity.
A NYT columnist name-searched himself, got called a bedbug in a zero-RT post, emailed the guy's boss super weirdly, was found out and made fun of, quit Twitter, and went on TV to compare it to the language used by totalitarian dictators. This is *unbelievably* embarrassing stuff
Dear Twitter Friends   As a Special Olympics Athletes   My weight loss progress   I lost 32 pound ❤️
#BretStephens is on @MSNBC saying Twitter "brings out worst in people." Says GW professor used dehumanizing language. He is obsessing about being called a "bedbug."  "I had no intention of getting him in professional trouble," Stephens said.  OMG, the white male fragility tears.
A note on #BretStephens and Twitter trolling:  To any guy complaining about online attacks, understand that it's a drop in the bucket compared to what women — particularly women of color — deal with on a daily basis: Rape threats, death threats, threats against their kids, etc.
Bret Stephens is leaving Twitter to spend more time with his wife and hatchlings
Did Bret Stephens also quit email? Because that is what led to his problems—not Twitter. And in that respect, he has no one to blame but himself. He took no personal responsibility whatsoever, unsurprisingly. He should still face significant consequences for abusing his position.
Bret Stephens never responded to the dozens of climate scientists who pointed out serious errors in his first NYT column.  But make a joke on here without even tagging him and he demands a family meeting then rage quits Twitter.  Real bedbug move if you ask me.
400K on Twitter. ❤️🤞🏾
Every season is vacation season ⛱  Enter on Twitter to win 7 nights in Hawaii—with spending money included—brought to you by #TMobileTuesdays and @bookingcom 🎉
I’ve woken up this morning to an astonishing torrent of kindness and love. I can’t believe our beautiful daughter is trending on Twitter! I’m so sorry I can’t reply to your messages; I’ve read every single one and they mean the world to my wife and me. Thank you so much xx 🥰
But seriously though... How has Joe Walsh used the n-word so many times on Twitter and never been banned?
gonna go ahead and guess that if you think being called a bedbug sets a new standard of incivility, no one has ever threatened to rape you on twitter dot com
bret stephens would not survive 3 minutes of being a woman on twitter tbh
So somebody just said  the meaning on twitter is “wuti a nawa tã 😂🤣🤣
Can tennis twitter stop treating Serena Williams  vs. Maria “Dope Fiend” Sharapova like it’s a rivalry now? Serena beat the brakes off Sharapova 6-1, 6-1 today. That’s 19 consecutive wins against her. That’s not a rivalry, it’s a decade+ long ass whooping.
Last 10 Days at Twitter Philanthropy   ✅Donated $8,900 to a teammate with colorectal cancer  ✅Raised $1,200 to keep a vet from being evicted with @codeofvets ✅Raised $400 to help a vet with food and gas with @codeofvets ✅Helped teachers get supplies
There is no platform or execution that holds the same value forever. Loved spending money in my career on  Radio Newspaper Banners Email lists Direct mail Google Twitter Facebook Influencers Podcast Snap Instagram YouTube Spotify Some are still deals, many have become overpriced
Oh my god, I wasn’t prepared for your replies. I’m bawling my eyes out in the lounge. Thank you, Twitter. Thank you from the bottom of my heart xx
Joe Walsh on MSNBC: "I wouldn’t call myself a racist, but I’ve said racist things on Twitter.”
Request a few graphic artists to create a 'Pakistan First' twitter /FB/IG banners (in English & Urdu, Sindhi, & Pashto if possible). Please watermark your work, so you get proper credit. Let's show the world a taste of Pakistani talent as well as national cohesion! 🇺🇸❤️🇵🇰
I’m so touched by the huge support I’ve received from Iranians on Twitter after regime threatened FDD & me. No one knows better than they do how brutal, corrupt, repressive, destructive & odious this regime is. One day, they will live in a free & democratic Iran.
The main consequence of Joe Walsh’s announcement is that the guy who once dropped the n-bomb on Twitter is now the second most racist Republican running for president.
september better be chris mccarrell’s time as twitter’s white boyfriend of the month or what even is the point of broadway  c’mon stan twitter, don’t slack on us
It's working!?
Meanwhile they don't know what a PhD in Tweeting feels like
Should I take a Helicopter from downtown NYC to JFK Airport to catch my flight? Or rush, save the money, and give the money away on Twitter Philanthropy? I think I’ll rush, cut it close, and give away the money. Yea, that sounds good.
More and more “RICH” people are joining Twitter Philanthropy. GOOD! I will always work to involve only those who I think are SINCERE. We should all be skeptical within reason and it can be tough determining everything that’s going on. Pls Due your own due diligence. PRAY FOR ME!
Why do I have The Persistence on my Twitter?  Persist is defined as “continue firmly in a course of action in spite of opposition.”  While the democrats are all about resistance, our motto is  Persistence Trumps Resistance. #MondayMotivation
IT Cell trending on Twitter since yesterday to sack me - Do I work for the Twitter? What a bunch! #AltSarkar
A note to my new Twitter followers:  Welcome to my page!  Here, I express myself and share updates on my work, writings, events and meetings.  When I see wrong, I don’t stay silent. Nobody is above criticizm, including myself.  Threatening anyone will result in a block.  Thanks🙏🏼
Do you want a new mattress? Comment below and we’ll pick 10 random people to get a new mattress. Please give @realMikeLindell a follow who is graciously supporting Twitter Philanthropy. We love companies that GIVE! ❤️
So @Twitter is sending notices to President of Pakistan @arifalvi and Federal Minister @MuradSaeedPTI , earlier they sent notice to @arsched - Twitter is not a platform to have freedom of speech!
I've been off Twitter for a whole 24 hours. I'm out of the loop. What have I missed?   - What did Trump do? - Who said a thing that people found offensive? - Who has been canceled?  - How many genders are there now?  Fill me in.
1. Open Twitter on vacation  2. See headlines about Trump nuking hurricanes   3. Throw phone into the Mediterranean   See you all in a week!
You publicly wished death on someone the day their family member passed away. You complain about hate speech and how it’s detrimental to society...and then turn around and spit out poison at a most the inappropriate time. But you keep think your morally superior of us, bud. 👍🏻
Just logged in to Twitter & saw that Trump thinks we can safely stop hurricanes with nuclear weapons.  Brb, going to move to new country & build a bomb shelter.
PosoCheck:  Twitter is allowing a far-left conspiracy theory to tend   In reality, "Olive Garden" does not donate to political candidates   This false conspiracy theory was also pushed by far-left outlet Newsweek
Just officially switched to “Dark Mode” on Twitter. Definitely late to the party and it’s going to take some adjusting but I’m excited to be part of such a powerful movement 🙌🏼
Years since they were founded:  Microsoft: 44 years Apple: 43 years Amazon: 25 years eBay: 24 years Netflix: 22 years Google: 21 years SpaceX: 17 years Tesla: 16 years Facebook: 15 years Spotify: 13 years Twitter: 13 years Airbnb: 11 years Uber: 10 years Snapchat: 8 years
thank you for 4m on twitter 💙
“Bernie Sanders is a thot!” I type frantically into twitter as Kamala Harris threatens to fire me from my internship
I don’t know who needs to hear this, but just because a Twitter handle has a bunch of numbers in it doesn’t mean it’s a bot. Lots of inexperienced Twitter users don’t change the randomly assigned handle Twitter gives them when they signup.
Hi!  You friendly reminder: try not to tell people what they should/shouldn’t be tweeting. If they want to address something, it’s their twitter.  You do you.  ❤️
So I was gone for most of the day and I just needed to check.  Is Twitter just for butts now? 😂🍑
I’m interviewing the one and only @pulte tomorrow morning for 2+ hours.  The man is giving away millions of dollars on Twitter to change people’s lives.  What questions do you have for him?
Off of twitter for the rest of the day.  My boys start school tomorrow and man are they whiny about it.    Have a great rest of your weekend, friends.
Andrew Luck really botched this whole thing by not consulting Colts fans, the media and all of Twitter before making this gigantic life decision for his family. Hopefully others will learn from his mistake.
The only reason Pakistan has declared a Twitter war on India, is that Twitter is free.
So all those who are trying to be so cool about 7 million of our own people living with limited to no communication, restricted movements, fear and insecurity and declining rations, do the following:  1) Get off Twitter now 2) Throw your mobile SIM away For just 1 week!  #Kashmir
TWITTER: Carbs are not essential for human survival! (So must be bad)  TRUTH: Carbs produce far more energy per unit of land than any other macronutrient.  In fact, there literally isn’t enough space on the 🌍 to feed us all on fat & protein alone.  Sounds pretty essential to me.
And y’all think y’all voice mean something on Twitter 😂😂😂
I love accidentally creating a meme, sorry twitter
i was not ready to see this many butts on twitter today
I don't have "mentors."  I have dozens of people I ask for advice on specific things - often relationships purely through email or Twitter - but no people I go to consistently.  Life is too complex to have three people tell me how to live it.
Hey Patriots- please retweet the video clip above. Encourage people to watch and share. Drop the link in liberal groups. Share with democrat friends. Drop link in comments under fake news twitter accounts. Let’s get our message out! Please retweet!! #WalkAway
I hate when ppl be tweeting emotional and “deep” tweets on twitter like get outta here if ur gonna be tweeting that shit I’m not tryna see that stuff
The man who cuts my hair (great guy) says Twitter Philanthropy is The Talk of the Shop! Loves it. Cool. 😎
Twitter fixed @Etika account & kicked out the Hackers!
Marcus Rashford was subjected to racial abuse on Twitter after missing a penalty in Manchester United's loss to Crystal Palace.
I tried to talk sense to them to get off his account. But they wouldn’t listen. Reached out to Twitter just now they are on it.
Twitter is a virtual Chatroom… Nothing more.. Millions of people talkin all kinds of shit…  get in and get out..
Stop whining on twitter and go back to the G7. Just try not to embarrass us for the 863th day in a row.
David Koch: *dies peacefully on a huge bed of oil money after a long life in which he achieved most of his right-wing political goals, leaving behind a world roasting in the heat of the climate change he denied*  Left Twitter: Hahaha, you DIED, we WON
Every verified account on IG that posted that fake copyright message has moved on to a “black twitter generated 67 billion dollars this week but you won’t buy my cousins Shea butter” post
Dear Twitter Friends   As a Special Olympics Athletes   Thank you everyone for wishing me a Happy Birthday ❤️    My birthday was the best   Since am 30 am excited for my new chapter    I can’t wait to see what my 30 has in store for me ❤️  I love you all ❤️
How has Twitter Philanthropy changed your life?
The fascinating thing about Twitter is you can see a guy *make exactly the same argument as you, in almost exactly the same words* and get a completely different set of replies. Sometimes it feels like there is a Men’s Twitter and a Women’s Twitter.
Donald Trump can’t figure out how to win his trade war, or the 2020 election, or the battle to keep himself out of prison.  But he’s convinced that if he comes up with just the right Twitter zinger, he’ll win the internet .

“#SUPAFRIENDS ALERT : if you tweet using #MissyElliott #ThrowItBack #SupaFriends #Iconology or #SupaDupaFly you get to unlock a custom Missy Twitter emoji”
RT if you love dogs. Delete your Twitter if you don’t.
In case y’all didn’t know.....my Twitter fam is the best.
Trump was damn near ready to kill Jerome Powell over some rate hikes, but Jair Bolsonaro perpetuating the burning of the world’s most vital ecosystem and the best Trump can do is some casual offer to help via Twitter.
Stock market crashed 50% heading into the ‘74 midterms. Senate GOP grownups told Nixon they were done defending Watergate. He resigned.   But Nixon didn’t have Fox News brainwashing or Twitter gaslighting for him. Different world. They’re going over the falls with him LMAO.
Calling American public servants enemies won’t do anything to support American jobs. President Trump should get off Twitter & get to work, by putting tough Buy America rules in place & closing the loopholes in his own tax law that reward corporations for sending jobs overseas.
Sources briefed on the president’s thinking say to expect a new tariff announcement imminently and to keep an eye on his Twitter.
Nunes' lawyer, Steven Biss: "I  don't want to say she was fleeing, but she fled to Connecticut." Judge Marshall: Told him it was uncalled for to make unproven allegations like that. Biss: "That's why I said I didn't want to say it." Courtroom full of @DevinCow supporters laughed.
As you scroll through your Twitter feed, I invite you to consider how your time here allows you to uplift and connect with others. I echo the words of President Nelson that we put ourselves at risk if we “pay more attention to feeds . . . than to the whisperings of the Spirit.”
Big day for #Thala fans today..  - #NKP ruling the Box office..  - #Viswasam the No.1 #Twitter Tag of 2019 1st Half..  - #2YrsOfBiggestBBVIVEGAM
People want to know: How can I access Twitter from a safe house, even with Faraday cages, signal jammers, etc. Answer:  Multiple private VPNs coupled with multiple public VPNs in the outer shell. Would take 10 years to unwind. We're in my bailiwick now mof-<ckers!
Protestants on Twitter: show me IN THE BIBLE where Mary is Queen of Heaven  me: rev 12:1  Protestants: show me IN THE BIBLE where it says we should listen to the pope  me: luke 10:16  Protestants: show me IN THE BIBLE where it mentions confession  me: john 20:23  Protestants: 🙉

Dear Twitter,  I’d like to announce that I’m putting my streaming, casting, singing, and dancing careers on hold to pursue being a full time Minecraft esports professional.  I hope you’ll support me on this journey.  With Love, Uncle Jack
Well..... my results just came back from my CT scan last Friday for my lung and my oncologist said it’s BENIGN!!!!!!!!! Been crying tears of joy with the kids for an half an hour. I’m so beyond grateful for your love and support here in my twitter family. 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
- No I didn’t get his name or make a complaint. As I said, he didn’t mistreat me so while I despair that an official made these comments and that these troubling views have clearly been so normalised, I didn’t take it any further. (I just moaned about it on twitter!)
I notice that my mental health takes a steep decline if I spend any time on Twitter. So I'm looking for FUNNY, UPBEAT, POSITIVE, GOOD accounts to follow (and slowly unfollowing all the horror). Please recommend your fave feelgoods, and please RT so I can find LOADS. Thankyou! 🥰
I know this isn’t popular to say on Twitter and it won’t play with the coastal elites, but Senator Scott, I just want you to know that, as a native Floridian whose parents you represent, you look like the trash can man from Stephen King’s the stand
Which is your favorite account on Twitter?
CONSERVATIVES: Twitter is not biased against you. The “mainstream media” is not biased against you. Science is not biased against you. History is not biased against you. Pop culture is not biased against you.  You’re just wrong about everything.
Hi, Twitter. Welcome to the stand-up recommendation thread. Here are the rules:  Step 1: Comment, "I love [your fave comedian] and need a new special to watch.” Step 2: Give someone else a recommendation! Step 3: Have fun :D
This Rihanna/Shaun King thing is so distressing. It's bad enough that what Black women have been shouting about him can't seem to gain traction outside of organizer Twitter.--him receiving this honor from someone as revered as Rih will essentially make him unimpeachable.
Shout-out to the gentleman in the plum-colored slacks who said "I love your Twitter!" on the street this afternoon. I didn't catch your name, but you made me smile!
Good morning, and happy dorm move in day to everyone except the people tweeting at the police twitter account about what is and isn’t legal when driving.
I just wanna say, so many of y’all are wonderful. I’ve been on Twitter for a decade. I’ve learned from you. Laughed with you. Yeah, there are trolls, Nazis and Karamo here too, but that’s true offline as well. I don’t want to underestimate the value of the notable good here.
I have officially crossed the 3M follower mark on Twitter! Thank you to all of you for making this happen and a special thank you to @DannyElrod3 for being my 3 millionth follower!
Beware of the accounts that started recently, have 8 numbers in the handle and generic profile pics. Some look like liberal twitter accounts. They're phishing...they want other liberals to follow them and eventually, they'll post disinformation. Don't assume anything.
Dear Twitter Friends   As a Special Olympics Athletes   Tomorrow is my birthday ❤️    Am excited ❤️  I be dancing ❤️  I be 30 ❤️  We gonna have a Tank birthday dance party ❤️
Going to do a Q&A here on @Twitter tomorrow afternoon. ✌🏼👍🏼 You can send me your questions using #AskIlkay 🎱 I will try to answer as much as possible.
nothing helps me forget about the insignificant stresses in my life like the current apocalypse that is the world. which is burning by the way.  the earth is burning.  and we’re all on twitter.
My current favourite twitter handle to follow is @LOLrakshak  Bhayankar funny maro follow!
Twitter: Save Amazon!  Media: OMG WHAT happened to the global e-commerce giant 😱 Twitter: no no, the Amazon rainforests  Media: eeeeh pass 😒
Undiminished Protest in #Hongkong against China led Chinese social media to promote violent & reactionary posts.A post on Weibo(Chinese parallel to Twitter) suggests the Communist government:’they (protesters)must be beaten to death.Just send a few tanks to clean them up’
Australian Senator @PaulineHansonOz has been given a temporary Twitter suspension for expressing her opinion. Meanwhile every other account that wanted her to die while climbing Uluru is still active. You don’t have to support Pauline, but we have to support fairness. Thank you.
Guys there is ample documentation of the issues here. And @angryblacklady has been discussing this on her twitter feed for quite some time. Educate yourselves.
I'm very pissed off / Woke up ds mornin on twitter they making a list of / Best MCs in Africa me #6 ? that is a rip off / Show me d rapper in Africa goin commercial but still reppin hip hop/ I walk in the jungle with no fear I be like Shaka Zulu in flipflops   King @sarkodie 🔥🙌🏿
Nsfw twitter is gonna have a field day when this comes out
The president can tweet insane shit,like proclaiming himself to basically be Jesus,but if someone replies to his craziness,they can be put in Twitter jail like my friend  @ecosexuality was after a bunch of MAGA trolls mass reported her.  @twittersupport  won’t even respond to her
GOT MY TWITTER BACK!!! What did I miss?!
it's about time a CSGO Major had its own hype Twitter hashflag (that's what they're called)  the #BerlinMajor is about to be lit
None of you know who chief keef is smh this is why I hate twitter
I been at 2.5m followers on Twitter for like 3 years!   Its hard to grow when you go from being hated to loved every other day! Can you just love me till i hit 3M ?   Thanks
How was the twitter crash experience? Anxiety attacks? Nervous breakdown?
The mid-night arrest of Mr. Chidambaram by Modi-Shah should wake up country's opposition. No one is safe. Congress should hit the streets, twitter is not good enough.
It’s classic Trump to manufacture a crisis, blow it up on Twitter, insult an ally, embarrass America  ...and next he’ll claim victory...
I don’t know. Maybe it’s time to turn off all of Twitter, wait a few seconds and then turn it back on. Maybe that will make it less...horrifying?
Twitter removed thousands of fake Chinese-created accounts that amplified its state-run media messaging disparaging Hong Kong protestors. Now China is complaining that its free speech rights were violated.   China complaining about lack of free speech. Let that sink in.
I know he is morally sick btw. How do we even write satire anymore? He wants to buy Greenland. He governs on Twitter.
We have reached a point as a civilization where "King of Israel" is trending on Twitter and it is about Donald Trump, the President of the United States.
The support we have received from all around twitter community is truly amazing. Almost 40,000 people followed @AuschwitzMuseum within the last 18 hors. It's overwhelming and very encouraging. Memory links people. 750,000 seems doable indeed.
Wake up. Drink coffee.  Look at Twitter.  POTUS claims to be Jesus Christ.  Just another day in America.
Twitter will meet Man Utd within the next few weeks to discuss the racist abuse aimed at Paul Pogba following Monday night’s game with Wolves.
OMG ANG DAMI KONG KAILANGAN GAWIN WAIT LANG *proceeds to scroll thru Twitter and Facebook and Instagram*
I’ve heard from a few publications, journalists, and people working on major national political campaigns that something weird has been going on with their @Twitter accounts over the last week or so in regards to their engagements and followers
IM LOOKING for talent that have MORE than just instagram. Youtube, Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook, instagram, personality AND humility. Brands need you. And I’m here to connect💫
Hmmm. A twitter handle that just just joined twitter, has one follower and no tweets has just decided to make their first tweet a complaint about the one-sidedness of our Kashmir coverage 🤔  Basically everyone is now playing this game. It's pretty wild.
eboys will pick a booger just to get a nose bleed so they can take pics for twitter

The overarching goal of Twitter Philanthropy is to inspire Americans to help Americans. This movement is much much than giving away money.  We are inspiring HOPE. We are shining our American Spirit. We are reigniting selfless giving. We are redefining philanthropy.
While capitalism and white supremacy continue to destroy our country, many of you choose to spend your time reporting Black and brown people to Twitter over our use of the term "white people." You call us reverse racists for using the term "white people."
A Twitter milestone (700k followers) and an opportunity to thank all of you. Trolls are gonna troll, but I'm pleased  so many come to engage in respectful dialogue even when we disagree. I'm grateful for this unlikely, unexpected but deeply satisfying chapter of my life. Onward.
Hey @Twitter why do you allow Trump to smear with lies, bully and incite hate against a person using your platform?!  If anyone else did this they would be banned from Twitter. Do you have no sense of decency?!!
Are you gonna do any actual work today, or are you just gonna f**k off on Twitter all day again? Every day, same thing. Worst, laziest, most incompetent president ever... #Trump
One more time for the kids in the back (& because Twitter can never take things at face value) I WILL BE ANNOUNCING @WWENXT ON @USA_Network EVERY WEDNESDAY AT @FullSail Now back to your regularly scheduled trol-I mean tweeting.😎❤️🙏🏻 #NXTOnUSA
The abuse of Paul Pogba is a disgrace. No place for this vile racism and social media should act swiftly to take it down (that means you, @Twitter).  #SayNoToRacism #KickItOut #StandUptoRacism
It’s nearly 10 AM, the economy is turmoil, there are international incidents in Iran, Hong Kong, and the India- Pakistan border and the President seems to sitting in his bedroom engaging in Twitter wars with a former staffer and two news networks
Sell in the ring .... Not on Twitter .
Given how many Eagles fans on this Twitter think Dak Prescott is just awful, I find this statistic illuminating. Prescott has four game winning drives against the Eagles. Carson Wentz has four game winning drives in his entire career.
Dear Twitter Friends   As a Special Olympics Athletes   My weight loss progress    I lost 31 pound ❤️

Fake video alert. Old video of mock drill by MP Police. Shameless Pakistan trolls badly want to instigate violence in India.
#IndiaReadyForWar say twitter warriors from the comforts of their living room.
In the 2016 primaries there were constant wrathful fights between Hillary and Bernie supporters on Twitter. In this cycle, there aren't even any Biden supporters on Twitter to fight with... yet he leads every poll
President Donald Trump took $60 million from Planned Parenthood. For this reason and many more he gets my vote. He could be as rude and crude as he wants to on Twitter. He gets results. #PromisesMadePromisesKept.
Twitter is freaking epic
🙄are you still here? Didn’t Hillary Clinton destroy you earlier today on twitter? #boybye
There's literally no better marketing strategy than Black twitter organically supporting your business. WOW.
Was told that certain idle folks are doing videos(I don't watch) against my giving out cash to my followers on twitter..DON'T YOU EVER LEARN?. the more videos and write up,the more am becoming bigger by his grace.i pray for God to bless ne so I keep blessing people.(genesis 12.2)

A man, well known, wanted a car from me in early July. After he didn’t get a car, he writes something not so nice on Twitter about us. I still love you man!  ❤️🇺🇸
1 million followers on twitter wtf? i’m hoenestly surprised that this many ppl follow my constant tweet & deletes, boy problems, pussystunts, and overall shady entitled bitchy tweets. love u 💞
Dear @Twitter the twitter account of our tv show host @immishalbukhari has surprisingly suspended. She is on twitter 2012. Mishal is responsible&seasoned journalist of Pakistan and conducting prime time talk show. It is requested her account may be restored.  Thank you @aapnewspk
These covert, manipulative behaviors have no place on our service — they violate the fundamental principles on which Twitter was built. We hope that we can empower further learning and public understanding of these nefarious behaviors that undermine the public conversation.
now i have to fight the urge to order that damn sandwich. twitter is a trap.

popeyes chicken sandwich twitter is kind of my favorite twitter right now
Twitter isn't driven by moral values. It's a corporation driven by a single motive: profit!  And thus Twitter has made a commercial calculation that there's bucket loads of profit to be pulled from India, Israel and white nationalists but little from their critics or opponents.
The first rule of Twitter. Never, ever, ever engage with Corbyn twitter.  The second rule of Twitter. Never break the first rule. Ever.
I'm trying to work on Vegas stuff but Twitter is too distracting 😂
4/ So, call me or anyone in one of my Twitter threads a "libtard," & I block you. We should not need a personal reason to do the right thing for others. I do find there’s no ignoring when an attack against someone who is vulnerable feels like an assault on a person I have loved.
Trump, who regularly claims that he only hires the best people, now says on Twitter that Scaramucci's time at the White House was "11 days of gross incompetence."
Please don't give any attention to Chanda Khor like @Shehla_Rashid. Only report her handle to Twitter so that it could be suspended.  She herself want arresting for sympathy in Kashmir. She is no body, Just ignore.
10 days ago we reached 500K followers on Twitter. Since then we’ve gained another 24K followers (in 10 days). Our retweet reach is now officially over 100,000,000 a week.  Not one media channel that tried to discredit me has such impact.  Thank you, my friends. 🙏🏼❤️
*wakes up in the middle of the night, ignores all my texts and immediately opens twitter to tweet garbage*
Hey Twitter world!
Geraldo Rivera and Chuck Woolery are apparently having a huge Twitter fight right now. I wouldn’t know. They both blocked Palmer Report a long time ago 😁
Twitter can be awesome - check out #clearthelists to find a class in need. Contact your teachers and ask how to help. Gift cards are great, too. If you’re not in a financial place for that, write your teacher an encouraging note of gratitude and support! That goes such a long way
Straight Twitter always talking about fixing your man a plate like you know who's gonna fix my man's plate it's Postmates
woowwww you laugh at my jokes then throw me under the bus on twitter i seeee 👀👀😂
Quick prayer request for my lovely Twitter friends...  My aunt passed away last year suddenly and two days ago, my uncle, her husband passed suddenly. My cousin is now without his parents and best friends. If y'all could keep him in prayers, it would be much appreciated :)
The great dilemma of Twitter - do you respond/debunk the increasingly nonsensical/conspiratorial/dumb/racist takes from the right, thereby pushing back but maybe increasing their audience, or do you ignore and not amplify them, but leave the field open for Dumb and Dumber? 🧐
Basically Shehla Rashid wants to get arrested. She is deliberately spreading fake news to instigate violence. Instead of arresting, better to get twitter to suspend such Islamists who are trying to provoke violence.
The @JTonYouTube & ENES BATUR story is hard to cover cus that Psycho will just flag down my video...   Maybe I’ll make a twitter video instead so I can help him that way.
This is just getting extremely sad. No one actually thinks you’re the 26th most important anything, bro. You are obsessed with Twitter and yourself. I also like how you think no one supposed to be able to call you out on your BS otherwise we’re “hurting” the cause. 🙄 Get help.
One of the reasons there's no anti-war movement is because left-wing activists would rather pretend that Twitter trolls and 20 knucklehead white supremacist losers are where the real power in society resides
I’ve never reported any twitter user to their boss to be fired. I have helped people hire on twitter not fire. When folks get fired for being incompetent or for just being surplus to the needs of the coy., they look for excuses and as you’d already know, “Omojuwa did it” is valid
Except for those moments in real life where you go looking for the mute button & realize it's only on Twitter.
Dear Twitter Friends  As a Special Olympics Athletics  My beautiful message  I love to spread love because I love you no matter what I like to support everyone I care about everyone and I love to bring love and joy to everyone   My love and my beautiful heart will be with you ❤️
“Go look at Trump’s twitter,” the pro-violence, pro-misogyny, pro-white nationalist, pro-fascist said. “He talked about Portland, said he’s watching antifa. That’s all we wanted. We wanted nat’l attention, and we got it. Mission success.”  @realDonaldTrump, Hate-Inciter-in-Chief
This is quite possibly the biggest self own in Twitter history.
The very worst thing about any new Tarantino movie is the Tarantino Twitter fanboys. Grow the fuck up!
Twitter is so cliquey. Little surprise though, it's a reflection of real life - objectivity is highly discounted for familiarity.
Im on twitter more than any other app and hardly ever tweet. Yall be funny as hell on here, i could scroll all day 😂
Ahoy there. Having a day off from shooting The Invisible Man in Sydney. Scanning my Twitter feed can often bring me down, what with all the bad news out there, so I thought I'd take this opportunity to say thanks to those of you guys who allow me to tell stories for a living xo💋
Off twitter for a few days to say goodbye to the beautiful and boring little town in which I came of age. 4 days until New York! Bursting with anxiety and excitement and fear and depression and happiness and love and my god I’m going to be an adult in only a few years.   whoa
Very frustrating & annoying to watch @Twitter suspend & shutdown tweets of Pakistani youth & activists under pressure from India.  Protecting Free Speech on this platform should be mission & mandate for their Admins.  These voices of criticism should not & cannot be suppressed.
Man sees posed picture of attractive female. Decides to tweet that they don’t like the positioning inanimate objects in the background.   When your mom asks you why you’re still single...just show her your twitter account. 💋👑
You may have #Kashmir on a media and communication black out but you can’t silence rest of the world. Lobbies at work & Twitter accounts getting shut down if you say “too much”. @jack #FreedomofExpression
I share a lot of my personal life on my twitter mostly as a reminder than i'm a real person behind all the stream stuff. I'm not a robot that just turns off and on when the stream is live. It's therapeutic for me and an may help someone else out there feel not alone in feelings
Trump should start a podcast. A sort of 21st century Fireside chat. It would immediately be the biggest podcast in the country  Great campaign tool that nobody is using right now- as far as I know  Trump bypassed the media with Twitter. Podcast is an even better way to do that
So another Pak Twitter account suspended for tweeting on Kashmir and against Rogue Modi Govt's actions. Does Twitter work for Indian govt now? Such a bias - please let me know @nighatdad since u work on digital rights issues so may be better informed on twitter-India link.
Good Morning. I read through MANY of the Thousands of DM’s. If I unfollow u, it’s because I need to be able to msg with my sibilings and personal life. Pls understand. Twitter Philanthropy is changing the world. We changed lives this week. Big giveaway this a.m. Love you all ❤️
Can’t believe I’m even apologizing to harry styles stan twitter lol but, I was explaining why u can’t compare artists and their songwriting processes cause the credit system is outdated. I would never come for harry. He literally gave birth to me.
Every now and then, when I think Twitter is really bad, I go back over to Facebook for a moment and then I feel like being on Twitter is like hanging around the Library of Alexandria
Can someone please help this drunk old lady? She's making a fool of herself on Twitter.
Just hit 200K on #Twitter. Thank you. 🙏
Glad to see OJ loving life 😊 it's nice to know that there is hope for a peaceful life for anyone, even someone who brutally murdered two people in cold blood! Take care Twitter world!
Teachers who came to Twitter because they wanted people to #clearthelists, stay. Don’t go away as soon as you get the stuff you need. Edu Twitter is a fantastic place to learn.   Take your coats off and stay a while.
a Vizio representative called me and offered compensation for the issue that was brought to her attention on Twitter. thank you all for the solidarity, its a really powerful force. okay next order of business lets get ICE abolished
Does Tim Cook feel good about dining with Trump after he goes on these bizarre and deeply offensive twitter attacks on a sitting member of Congress?
Sad to hear about Peter Fonda. I always loved Easy Rider and he was also a nice Twitter friend to me. RIP.
Yes, Kentucky Street is closed, no, you can’t see it from 19th Street, keep your eyes on your driving, and no, you shouldn’t be reading Twitter while driving and being an accident looky loo. Thank you.
Rep Omar lies so often that I caution anyone seeking to preserve their dignity to double and triple check anything on her twitter feed before retweeting it and humiliating yourself.
i swear i check my twitter notifications 24/7
India has launched a massive war against all social media accounts exposing its war crimes. Hundreds of FB & Twitter ids have been closed.... All because India had signed agreements with these platforms years ago, while Pakistan never bothered.  Now, in war, we are getting hit...
It took me 9 years to reach 12,000 Twitter followers... and then 7 months to reach 108,000.  Progress is often not linear.   Just keep going, keep being you and the world will eventually catch on.   Don't chase trends because trends change. Authenticity wins. 👌🏾
Today, we’re changing the way third-party apps request authorization to your Twitter account, and what they can do with that access. We want to help you make more informed choices by clarifying what apps can do when you authorize them.
People be dragging celebrities for not helping them on Twitter, Sometimes you help people and you must not brag about it. Don’t forget that Your favorite celebrities are humans too. I will continue helping where I can. 🙏
I blocked you because you are not worth civil engagement. Nobody can trust you as you don’t respect privacy. And you share content on twitter that is produced by Pakistan ISPR. I invited you for a debate in good faith but you exposed your gutter level mentality. Goodbye cheat!
Taking a break from Twitter. Facts, humour, news, commentary, fighting extremists and spreading peace need a peace of mind. Enjoy your weekend.   ❤️🙏🏼
Before you talk crap about me or anybody else on Twitter, go call up your mother and tell her you love her.  How you gonna be hating when you haven't spoken to you mom in 3 weeks?  Get your priorities straight... 😄
#GELATO 🍦 is currently the number 1 twitter trend in Nigeria!!!! 🤯
I’m reliably informed that Gazza is back on @Twitter... well, it’s come from the man himself, so probably not that reliable. Anyway follow @PaulGascoigne19 and give him some Twitter love. 😭👀
Indian Defnece Minister just hurled a nuclear threat on twitter, everyone should report that tweet and let Twitter know!
Social media giant Twitter has agreed to discuss racist abuse with football anti-discrimination group Kick It Out for the first time.
Imagine if Stan twitter existed in 100,000,000 BC where everybody’s saying shit like “maybe if grogg stan fire, grogg not get hit with big rock. And I OOG-“
Jo Swinson is trying to stop Jeremy Corbyn blocking no-deal.  Her Twitter fans think those of us who want to see the leader of Her Majesty's Official Opposition block no-deal are a 'cult'.  The debasement of politics by the 'centre' is a curious thing indeed.
do I like dark mode twitter cause it reminds me of tumblr?
Dear @instagram,  In the last 10 days, I’ve gained hundreds of followers per day on Twitter AND on Facebook. PER DAY!  But, on Instagram, after gaining hundreds of followers PER DAY since March, I’ve been stuck at the EXACT same number. Is it my aftershave—or my conservatism?
just googled "how to stop executive dysfunction," skimmed the google results, then went back to twitter,
I wish you could send public voice notes on twitter as replies cause there’s a lot of stuff you just wouldn’t understand in pure font.
Wasn't there a mass murder at a Walmart last week by a guy who was essentially quoting your rally speeches/Twitter feed? Mass shootings and gun homicides are a "great indicator as to how the U.S. is doing" too. Gun violence, white domestic terrorists, NRA/GOP in bed together.
Twitter finally verifying me and giving me the respect I deserve!!!!
The US should issue 100 year bonds:  -buy Greenland -pay off all student loan debt -get everyone a Peloton -free guac at Chipotle for a year -give every citizen $10k to open an IRA -universal (free) WiFi -fix the damn roads/bridges -take Twitter private & make it a public good
In Breaking Petty AF news...  Barack Obama still has over 40 million more followers than Donald Trump on Twitter.  This has been an important Petty AF news brief.  PETTY AF 😂😂😂😂😂😂

Ngl twitter boys in my mentions. This topic touches you because your mum still pays your phone bill. It’s okay. I get it.
Shadow banning is the Antifa of Twitter: an almost entirely imaginary construct meant to explain irrational grievances and insecurities.
Lib Dem supporters&trolls should stop wasting their time on twitter having a go at me, instead they should use the valuable time convincing their leader Jo Swinson to reconsider her stance on Jeremy's offer. Caroline Lucas is asking Jo Swinson to reconsider too, its time to act!
How many times have you had to refollow Republicans on Twitter that you are sure you were already following? I just had to refollow two.
One day Twitter folks will finally learn not every messi tweet need a Ronaldo comment.
President Trump today violated right in front of all eyes, on Twitter, the Speech and Debate clause of Article I
Only for V
appreciation Tweet 🙏
You people on Twitter didn’t ginger me enough so I will not release #GELATO today o... 😔
I #WakeUpToRacism every morning when I look at Donald Trump’s twitter feed.
‘Virtue signalling’ is the world’s worst insult. Better to signal virtue than to signal you are a selfish wanker. Wanker signalling is the real problem with Twitter.
Dear Twitter Friends   As a Special Olympics Athletics  I be playing Golf today    I be playing 18 hole   I be playing Golf in the morning   8:15 am is when I start   Am gonna have fun ❤️  Keep myself calm ❤️  Cheer for me everyone ❤️
Twitter today is a place where people defend Conor McGregor for punching an innocent man in the face and piss all over a 16 year old for making a point about the climate.
Don’t worry if you haven’t done well in your A Levels. At least you’re not a middle aged man on Twitter wishing death on a 16 year old girl who just wants to save the planet.
If you join a twitter conversation to say “why are you all even acknowledging this person or topic?” why are you acknowledging the acknowledgment if you’re so wise and above it all? Leave us alone.
Arron Banks’ vile tweet about @GretaThunberg makes me sick to the stomach  I have made a formal complaint to Twitter.
Hi I'm a 50-year-old snowflake-hating media pundit, just logging on to twitter to lose my shit at a teenage girl (for the fifth time this month) because she's not a huge fan of the planet dying in a big ball of flames.
Shocked to hear that @RitaPanahi has been (temporarily) suspended by Twitter over a tweet from 2017—One  that’s nowhere near the truly violent tweets on this platform that hardly attract Twitter’s wrath. Rita is a great person. Bias against Conservatives is real, and disgusting.
Happy birthday, Mila Kunis! You’re not on Twitter, so I started an account for you. It’s called @ellentube. Everyone go follow it!
If So Much Fun goes number one I’ll never be annoying on twitter again.
Just to be clear the people “fighting for their lives” are the ones marching in the streets, staring down tanks—not you on your keyboard crusade on Twitter dot com.
Nothing says “I’m a real person who is on the up-and-up” like eleven digits at the end of your twitter handle
We have faith you'll find a smart toilet to Tweet from if you need to

Thank God there was no twitter in 1946 or else we would never get independence. Imagine all our freedom fighters just tweeting protests.
I’m not overly dark unless I’m going through one of my bouts with depression.   I like to make other people laugh and feel good about themselves.   I have an amazing life. Truly.   Then comes twitter. It often stresses me out. It makes me anxious. I say things that are not nice.
Twitter has a very similar hold on me, although it’s nowhere as deadly as substance abuse obviously.   Those who know me in “real life”, know I’m a clown. A buffoon. I make jokes all day. I laugh all day. I have the maturity of a 10-year-old, at best.
This morning, a teammate saw another teammate living in her car at a McDonalds parking lot with 2 kids.  Our teammate notified us, and you all raised $3,500 so they could get into transition housing and have clothes on their back. Wow, Thank You! This is Twitter Philanthropy!
Perusing twitter today leaves me wondering, who is the bigger national embarrassment: Ken Cuccinelli or Steve King.   It’s a very tough call.
I logged onto Twitter for five minutes and everybody was already miserable because of some garbage nobody will remember next week. Finally, a drug that only gives you a hangover. To think our parents had to run their heads into garage doors to achieve that.
So many attempts to Suspend my twitter account so many attempts to Hack My Accounts n emails.just to Stop me ventilating kashmir Cause.Cant Believe these maniacs can go to  any lengths to Quite voices  Representing Humanity & Exposing their Atrocities in #Kashmi #HumanityFirst
Dear @Twitter stop participating in genocide of Kashmiris. You don’t want your end along with Modi’s end.If blocking accounts that are exposing Modi’s terrorist mindset is ur ultimate goal then twitter’s owners will be exposed to the world as well.U r breaching international laws
Hat tip to twitter who is doing a good job of banning many fake accounts impersonating me. Remember, this is my ONLY account. Thanks @leslieberland and @jack !
Twitter suspends account of prominent anchor Imran Khan for responding to Indians on Kahsmir! @Twitter has a strange policy here! Kashmiris are not humans in their eyes?
Thank you for helping me reach 330,000 followers on Twitter.  If each of you registers 5 new Republican voters,   that's 1,650,000 votes for @realDonaldTrump in 2020. #WednesdayWisdom
Pakistani government must look into this and work with Twitter. A couple of days ago @MaleehaHashmey responded to an Indian army officer and he didn’t like the response and had Twitter send her a stern warning(she was blocked for a day as a last warning)
Twitter accounts being suspended on discussing #Kashmir … @Twitter Whats the policy regarding this? Kashmiris are not humans?
People who aren't homophobic or racist or misogynist don't follow you, Greg.   Twitter's algorithms just shove your nonsensical hatred into decent people's feeds and they feel compelled to respond because they know phony Christians when they see one.  Have a nice day.
ANNUAL REMINDER: 1. There are basically no 18-year-olds on Twitter, they're all on social networks you're not on. 2. The 18-year-olds that are here don't follow you. 3. They don't care what you got for your A-Levels or what you did afterwards anyway. 4. And nor does anyone else.
A huge thank you to our 250,000 Twitter followers. Three years on from the referendum and our movement has only grown stronger - with well over a million following across all platforms! The battle for Brexit isn't over, and we won't stop fighting until we get Britain out.
Karachiites: Time to launch #NameAndShame part of the #LetsCleanKHI drive.  If u see anyone littering, name them & shame them by postings pictures on Social Media. Tag @LetsCleanKhi on Twitter & Facebook! I will retweet & send all to the media as well! Enough is enough! Peace✌️
Most opposition parties + leaders in India have been reduced to Twitter accounts.
Earnest tweet: As much as twitter is awful and can bring out the "bad stuff," I realized during the limbo, esp when I couldn't remember ppl's user names and it was like they'd disappeared, that I do value the community and the friendships and the support here, so thanks!! 🤗♥️
edm twitter was lit when i followed 20k people to keep my timeline entertaining but now it just looks like everyone is being mean to each other.   life is hard enough we should be nice to each other on twitter
FBI was with Her.  CIA was with Her.  DOJ was with Her.  Media was with Her.  Twitter was with Her.  Facebook was with Her.  Hollywood was with Her.  Barack Obama was with Her.  Trump and we the people beat them all!

I've heard the news, re: Weisman.  He didn't lose his job and that's fine because I am not a cruel person. But it is also frustrating that a lot of his behavior will go unchecked. Will he truly understand what he did wrong here or will he chalk it up to the so-called Twitter mob?
Was off Twitter for 5 days. Came on here for a quick look 😖  Seems NI is engaged in mass "poke-each-other-with-a-stick" and some political "leaders" seem to think their role is to fetch bigger sticks.  What's to be gained by such anger and hate? It's simply generating more. 🙁
Here’s a fun twitter game to help procrastinate: what’s your fave instance of an actor in a bit part before they were famous that now seems bizarre? ie Amy Adams in Buffy, Anna Kendrick in Twilight or Natalie Dormer as “the lady who hits on Captain America”  Gifs/pics plz
Sometimes I stay off twitter  and social media to make sure I ain’t to caught up in the matrix . Then I jump back in the matrix because I know I can jump out 🤷🏾‍♂️✌🏾
In the last 24 hours the illegitimate president has tweeted 15 times & retweeted 16 tweets from nutjobs. His Twitter account is nothing more than the biggest propaganda machine ever. That should be highlighted when news outlets cover his tweets. Warning: This is Trump propaganda.
An icon
Worse is the fact @Twitter routinely shuts down pro-Kashmir accounts for sharing evidence of Indian crimes in the Muslim majority territory, but does nothing when Hindu nationalist trolls threaten to rape pro-Kashmir activists.  Why?   India is a revenue cash cow for Twitter!
My Blocked list on Twitter is longer than  my  followers list 😂...so i think i should unblock everyone as a good will gesture Of Benevolence towards my  Haters🤔...!!!  Wot u say...SHOUL I ? Or NOT ?
Good news for people who like it when I yell about unions, bad news for people who get pissed when the Twitter algorithm shows my tweets in the Metal tab:   I just filed a new @TeenVogue column, and am launching a *new* column on labor and class at another publication next week!
People who are shocked by my Twitter opinions seem to forget I AM THE GUY THAT STARTED A FIGHT WITH COLIN FARRELL AT A VEGAN CAFE
Fnatic: #alwaysfnatic @Twitter: We'll see about that.
I mean for fuck sake, white supremacy is on the rise, gun violence everyday, people of Flint have no clean water, your economy is fucking up Obama's great economy. Health care is crap, and all you are doing is bitching on Twitter, what the fuck is wrong with you?
Donald Trump is attacking everyone lately. I wish I was popular enough to get #EmmylessDonald to trend. That would at least irritate him when he goes on Twitter knowing he never won an award legitimately.
Thank you to whoever retweeted @MowashZA! I read about their service an hour ago on twitter, downloaded their app and booked an appointment for 2pm. They are currently outside washing my car. 😭😭👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 This is not a sponsored tweet. I just love and appreciate great service!
*asks if someone’s dog is “a he or a she” before petting it*  *gets offended when someone mistakes their baby for the wrong gender at the mall*  *names boat “Esmeralda” & uses she/her pronouns when talking about it*  *goes on twitter & makes fun of people who put pronouns in bio*
Very important reminder as we enter the next Bitcoin bull market:  - BTC is very volatile - You can lose all of your money - Only invest what is ok to lose - Twitter is not investment advice - Don't buy BTC with credit cards - Keep low time preference - Do your own research  🙏🏽🙏🏽
Indian Govt asks twitter to remove ARY's Senior Anchor .@arsched account
Will be doing Twitter live in 2 parts on Ram Mandir- Part 1: history & litigation  Part 2- Current situation  Part 1 today at 2.30-3pm.  It can be followed at @Ish_Bhandari
it takes me too long to find out why something is trending. twitter should first tell you why something is trending, at the top, rather than 8 million people continuing to make it trend by asking why it's trending I dunno
Someone on Twitter is going to get suspended for saying Fredo.
Writing with ADHD: - get up - eat - check emails - check twitter - shower - check twitter again - check emails - oh, it’s lunchtime - answer emails - check twitter - it’s 3:30pm, shit - write 12 pages in an unbroken 1.5 hour sprint until your hand hurts - oh wow! dinnertime
As President my first act will be to sign an executive order mandating twitter include IS NOT DEAD after the names of celebrities who are not dead but are trending nonetheless

Drama Alert has moved or is moving to.  Instagram Twitter Facebook Snapchat TikTok YouTube Myspace   ok that last one is a joke
I’m going give CASH in the next One Hour to random people that I choose who retweet this tweet and who are live on their twitter broadcast (click camera button to go live and must be following me so I can dm you)

We’re at Twitter HQ now! We are being held in a room until we answer your questions. Please ask now.  #askSamandColby
Don’t think there’s any 18 year old girl on Twitter who’s profile picture isn’t them stood on a balcony somewhere in Spain, whilst bending one leg slightly and holding a strawberry daiquiri?
The Mooch also spam-followed hundreds of thousands of people on Twitter hoping to get follow-backs to up his follower count, and then later mass-unfollowed them all to cover his tracks.  People who spam-follow are always complete phonies!!
Twitter is not sending notification of my tweets...  So, please check my account yourself every hour.....  It's a tough fight alright...but worth it all the way....
If there were a Twitter Hall of Fame, honoring the best tweets of all-time, what would be your nominee?
Guys, there is a video of arwah Syed Danial (who recently passed away due to the car incident) showing his body lying there circulating on Twitter. If you see it, please report it. Don't retweet it. Don't quote tweet to tell people to report it. Just. Report. It.
You only care about being relevant in the news. That’s all. No one has heard of Tony Sweetpea Posnanski. I’m a Twitter nobody. And the only reason you specifically respond to me is simple. I’m truthful.
If there is one thing I have learned from twitter this weekend it's that when I die I want my body forced into the salmon cannon and violently launched upstream thank you twitter
When Leffen pops off at a tournament and all his DBFZ buddies on Twitter congratulate him... It warms my heart every time
Priti Patel is just getting her policy ideas from the Twitter bios of middle aged Chelsea and Rangers fans
It's been more than 19 hours since :  1) Zomato delivery boys protesting against delivering beef & pork  2) Zomato forcing them to deliver  3) Delivery boys on strike since a week  But Zomato has not responded yet on Twitter? What happened? Response has also no religion like Food
Terrible that someone as courageous creative and inspiring filmmaker as @anuragkashyap72 has had to leave @Twitter because of personal malicious threats to his family, just because he expressed his own beliefs. I often disagree with him, but that does not mean I don’t admire him.
I apologize that I’m just not feeling Twitter today.  I have no doubt that the daily insanity of this administration will inspire me to new levels of snark quite soon.   Today I just cut up some more trees, and made a shepherds pie for dinner. Not the most intellectual of days.
Twitter is definitely the best & the most funnieyst social media...you guys are so funny lmao
From Teacher to Team: “The moment I realized you tweeted was when I checked my list and saw all but 3 items left in it! Then I went to Twitter to look! In shock! I am blown away by how people from all over whom I've never met felt in their hearts to give to me and my classroom!”
Dear Job Seeker,  Spend less time on @Twitter. Hit the streets. Buy @GuardianNigeria on Tuesday. Peruse job adverts. Upload your CV on @Jobbermandotcom. Identify firms you want to work at. Email them your CV. I give WISDOMS on my profile, not JOBS.   #FreeLeahSharibu #RenosDarts
i love twitter
. @ZaidZamanHamid account blocked by Twitter in India. Credit goes to Arnab , @republic & all the Social Media Activists
Both Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter Friday that Michael Brown was “murdered” by a “white” policeman in Ferguson, Mo. This is an absolute whopper and obviously does nothing to calm racial tension in this country. Yet it’s gotten almost no coverage.
Breaking: People are spreading memes and jokes on Twitter dot com and that is not allowed.
Just learned on @MediaBuzzFNC that @NicolleDWallace still has not apologized on her TV program for her incendiary falsehood that POTUS says he plans to exterminate Latinos. She had a half-apology on Twitter. No repercussions at her job for this shocking and dangerous false claim.
Dear Twitter Friends   As a Special Olympics Athletics  12 days left until my birthday ❤️    Am excited ❤️  I be 30 ❤️
I bet the same LIB who hit the "Twitter trend block" button used his Soros money to kill Jeffrey Epstein at the behest of Hillary.  Say it is fun to talk like a moron. I get it.
Sonu Nigam was threatened, had to shave his head & leave Twitter due to his Azan on loudspeakers tweet. Infact In MP, a man was stabbed for supporting him.  Anurag Kashyap left Twitter, said he's not allowed to speak his mind but recently he told that he speaks according to area.
@ the risk of being twitter shamed-I don’t care about Miley &Liam-Not even a little. I’m way more concerned about  * global warming  * kids in cages/orphaned by ICE * ppl being shot ... everywhere  * Injustice * black lives matter  * racism  & so much more
Just read through the Twitter feed of the @POTUS for the day-a wacky melange of rage, resentment and conspiracy theories, mixed in with the now customary coddling of the North Korean dictator. The remarkable, and disturbing, thing is just how unremarkable it is.
Not to mention Scaramucci spam-followed hundreds of thousands of people on Twitter hoping to get follow-backs to up his follower count, and then later mass-unfollowed them all to cover his tracks.  People who spam-follow are always complete phonies.
Trump’s Twitter Saturday:  - Retweets conspiracy theories about Jeffrey Epstein - Attacks the media - Praises Kim Jong Un - Attacks US-South Korea military exercises - Attacks Bill Maher - Accuses China of wanting a Dem in 2020 - Attacks Biden - Attacks Scaramucci
I wish I had fewer Twitter followers so I could say what I really think about Epstein without career-ending consequences
If you’ve lost a loved one to suicide, you might find this a rough day to be on Twitter. Lots of uninformed expertise, and jokes with no punchline. On we go.
SDNY: Jeffrey Epstein is dead  Bill Barr: I can handle this, just keep Trump away from Twitter  Trump: retweets conspiracy theory about Bill Clinton having Jeffrey Epstein killed
Salivating at the deaths of so many innocent people to ride trending hashtags on Twitter. Disgusting.
LOL! Twitter is creating their own trending topics #TrumpBodyCount   This one doesn’t even make sense. Everyone knows, including Democrats that those close to the Clintons that were scheduled for investigations or were investigating them ended with problems. #ClintonsBodyCount
Some people can’t take a joke or even having a little fun on twitter. Lightin’ the fuck up people. But seriously, I did blow his doors off!! 😂😂
Jeffrey Epstein held secrets that could bring down the presidency of Donald Trump.   So naturally, right wing Twitter has instantly blamed... the Clintons!
between IG and twitter the timeline is moving way too quickly and Denis and I can’t keep up 😭 thank you guys so much. We ❤️ you
Who killed Epstein?  Journos: Himself Leftist Twitter: Mass incarceration  Libs: Trump Centrists: Russia  MAGApedes: The Clintons  Right-wing Twitter: Mossad
The very first person I encountered outside of the house today, whom I do not know, told me unprompted that Jeffrey Epstein faked his own death. Folks, today is the day that the real world became Twitter, and this is the moment I spent ten years training for.
Important: Must follow #Twitter accounts for authentic information from #Kashmir:  1) DC Srinagar: @listenshahid  2) SSP Security: @hussain_imtiyaz 3) DIPR: @diprjk   Journalists for reportage: 1. @rahulpandita 2. @ashishsphotos 3. @AshishSinghLIVE 4. @rohanduaTOI 5. @AartiTikoo
So many people on twitter are describing themselves as Conservative, Christian, and then spewing hate about other human beings that I am beginning to think that you can’t be a real Christian and be a conservative at the same time.
extravagant twitter theory: powerful people wanted him dead!  grizzled former cops reporter theory: might be worth asking questions about the oversight and everyday conditions in that jail if this is how they’re managing a *celebrity* inmate
Donald’s Saturday:  Wake up Complain on Twitter Diet Coke  Lie on Twitter  Ignore son Ignored by wife Diet Coke Whine on Twitter Golf Diet Coke Embarrass U.S. on Twitter Bedtime
Yesterday, there were failed external attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Vice President’s Twitter Account. Since, we have been in contact with Twitter,  securing the account, and forestalling a reoccurrence. The VP will continue to actively communicate with our citizens.
Ordinarily I ignore this kind of thing but what happened next really pissed me off: an anonymous twitter account (since suspended) demanded “nudes” from one of my coworkers or they would release the supposed emails they had hacked.  So no I won’t stop making fun of Harry Cherry
I am currently in a war with Kid Rock because he attacked Taylor Swift.   Sometimes, you really have to love Twitter.
A proto-fascist, right-wing authoritarian is threatening to imprison Aaron Rupar, Joy Reid, Neera Tanden, Charlie Davis & Eric Boehlert. Actually, that's not happening & never will. Perhaps there's a difference between vapid, preening Twitter play-acting & actual #Resistance.
Groups like @RJC are subject to constant threats and hate speech.   Twitter does little to crack down on hate speech from the left, but goes to incredible lengths to shut down conservative voices like @Team_Mitch @Twitter needs to do more to ensure there is equal treatment.
Nobody believes you're going to #BoycottWalmart. You are going to tweet that hashtag out, hope to get some validation on Twitter and then march right in there and buy stuff like you always do because it's cheap and convenient.
You know who doesn't scream and yell on twitter about every little thing written or said about thier candidate?  Elizabeth Warren supporters.   No snark, no chants, no bros, just getting out there and pushing for thier candidate. Other campaigns should take note...
If Trump wanted to refute people who call him racist & say his rhetoric encourages violence he could do it easily. Take to Twitter or do an interview & tell his followers not to use violence against anyone. Say he rejects the idea that white people are superior. But, he hasn’t.
Driving is a privilege, not a constitutional right.  The 2A prevents our government from becoming fascist.  I’m going to guess by your week-long tirade on Twitter that you understand little about guns and even less about their laws, so you just don’t care why this is important.
Yes, Twitter geniuses, you are right that it's absurd for conservatives to be skeptical of Hollywood or think they'd make a movie attacking them. Where would these idiots get the idea that Hollywood would make a movie attacking them and their values? They would never do that!
Just letting everyone know that whoever hacked Liquid Poach’s Twitter threatened to hack mine next. If you see something uncharacteristic then you know why. I’ve taken additional measurements. Thank you all for following and the support. 🤟
Glad to see @Twitter has unlocked @Team_Mitch's account. This demonstrated bias is exactly why I have chaired @senjudiciary hearings calling for transparency of Big Tech’s censorship & banning processes – all of which Big Tech refuses to provide to Congress & the American people.
Twitter doesn’t care about your money; they place their ideology over income. Not buying more ads because of this doesn’t phase them at all.
When people use the phrase “send me a DM” on Twitter I have to stop picturing a Dungeon Master arriving at their door.
Twitter shows that relentless negativity is toxic. Instagram shows that relentless positivity is toxic.

At least she's communicating her feelings?
Rookies cemented their legacies last night after 1 game I am gathering from reading “the twitter” today. Got it.
If institutions like the Nigerian Police have to resort to twitter with grievances against the Nigerian Army, two most important institutns in the country, it explains why some of us have to come here with hard-hitting reports, despite condemnation that we do so only in private.
I feel more vulnerable now than I ever did. If the lack of coordination between Police and Army could lead to the death of 3 policemen & the escape of an alleged kidnapper, and it continues into a Twitter fight even after the President has set up an inquiry, how can I feel safe?
Niggas be gettin on Twitter like fuck it let’s cap
The personality traits that make someone think their quitting Twitter demands an essay make it impossible for them to quit Twitter. Twitter Quitter Paradox.
Has literally anyone who ever wrote a thinkpiece about "quitting Twitter" ever not returned to Twitter?
Did you know:  Mitch McConnell isn’t allowed access to this twitter account because he showed a video of people swearing at him and wishing him to die but Hamas has access to multiple twitter account despite being a massive terror organization who routinely kills kids
You will never regret not participating in a Twitter mob pile-on.
I never really glanced at twitter during a preseason game before... obviously... and man do y’all catch feelings good and bad very easily

If you spout negativity on my overwhelming POSITIVE feed or try to bait me into “politics”, I will have to block you. The world and Twitter has enough hate. We need LOVE!
Twitter has chosen to become a partisan outlet, silencing conservatives at the same they give the far-left a free pass on incendiary rhetoric. We will not be running any advertising on @twitter until @Team_Mitch is restored #ncsen #ncpol

Twitter just became culinary school, thank you Jungkook
Twitter always making me mad at people I didn’t know existed till I’m mad at them  Don’t hit ur pets it’s not complicated
The 20 words on Twitter most likely to be lengthened by repeating letters e.g. by turning ‘nice’ into ‘niiiiiice’, are: nice, ugh, lmao, lmfao, ah, love, crazy, yeah, sheesh, damn, shit, really, oh, yay, wow, good, ow, mad, hey, and please.
She’s written some embarrassing excuse on her twitter & it actually makes my skin crawl. A dog attacks an owner or human once, it’s put down. You spit at your dog, push him, are abusive towards him and you wanna apologise with a note in your iPhone on twitter? NO. You’re WRONG.
Dear @prakashraaj, I had posted a derogatory article against u n your family on 2 & 3rd October 2017. However I understand these were unwarranted n hurtful. Therefore, I unequivocally withdraw n regret Twitter n FB post.
. @desimojito account suspended by Twitter for 7 days just because he took on people. Shame on you @twitter
I did a really awesome in-depth interview today about music and existentialism within the millennial identity and billboard pulled the quote “it’s a miracle I haven’t killed myself yet” as the headline.  stan twitter humor ain’t really connecting in the real world.
me on youtube: you’re poor you’re a rat YUHHH  me on twitter: love you guys so much stay positive hope you’re doing okay yuh💕
Twitter poll: What is the worst movie you have ever paid to see in a movie theater?
I just received this direct message on Twitter:   "My 14-year-old son saw what you did and now he wants to start a movement in our hometown, which needs a LOT of cleaning up."
Donald Trump's day so far:  - Attacks Mayor of Dayton - Attacks Shepard Smith - Misspells Joaquin Castro's name - #GreenShirtGuy is a hero - Mitch McConnell gets locked out of one of his Twitter accounts - Impeachment is coming - Trump is going to prison - It's still only 9pm
1/ Trump says @AOC *needs to speak differently about policy* or she must *leave America*, but no, Twitter suspending McConnell's Twitter account temporarily because he posted audio/video of violent threats is the *real* "speech police"  No bigger snowflake than a Trump snowflake
Twitter suspended the Mitch McConnell's campaign account (@TeamMitch) for posting a video of protestors outside his house calling for him to be stabbed.... It's going to be a really hard sell for Twitter to claim they aren't biased against conservatives anymore.
Twitter suspended the re-election campaign account of the Senate majority leader today. Just think about it. In one stroke, Twitter has destroyed years of lobbying efforts by Big Tech which claimed there was no bias against conservatives.
I just can’t. They are attacking Lucy McBath and some jerk at the NRCC basically just said her dead son is a straw man.   I don’t curse on twitter so I have to log off now.
By suspending me for telling the truth, Twitter is making it clear that they seek to control the news media and only allow content on their platform that does not expose the evil, projection, and hypocrisy of the political Left.  Do not be surprised if they permanently ban me.
By suspending McConnell's re-election campaign for exposing the violent rhetoric directed at McConnell, which was allowed to foment on Twitter for days, Twitter is interfering in the 2020 elections in a manner to help Democrats and hurt Republicans
Twitter is only concerned that they could be blamed if something happened to McConnell because they allowed the hate against him to spread on the platform and to trend for days
WE, THE PEOPLE OF TWITTER, DO OFFICIALLY STAN @CouRageJD AND @ArianaGrande. Ws IN THE REPLIES.

My mental health is in shambles lately (and it seems like a lot of people are just generally ‘down’ after recent events), so, Twitter, in attempt to expose me/all of us to some positivity, tell me about the single best day of your life, so far. What was it? Why was it so awesome?
i try my best to avoid slamming people on twitter because i know what it’s like to be on the receiving end (and rightfully so), but this video of that girl hitting & spitting on her dog is remarkably grotesque, and irks me for many reasons:
hey twitter, i missed you.
What did math do to you?
But also:  Please Erase My Drafts At  Sunset

.@Twitter has served as a radicalization engine for many extremists. I have seen it firsthand.   Gebert, as "Coach Finstock," manned at least 10 handles that I could find.   We have a very serious problem with radicalization in America and social media execs play a role in it.
Trump claims that he "would like to stay out of the political fray" while his rivals are trying to "make political points" following mass shootings, but Trump just attacked Beto O'Rourke (who used to represent El Paso in Congress) on Twitter last night.
To be clear:   Congressman Joaquin Castro can dox moms and seniors and get away with it but Twitter suspended @PolishPatriotTM for posting conservative videos   Let that sink in
The following is a Public Service Announcement:     Hi @twitter friends!  Just a reminder, this space is for #MOSTLYSUNNY posts. If you’re  mean, I will BLOCK you. Take your  nasty mood somewhere else!   Have a nice day! 😃 Sincerely, The Management (Me) ☀️  JD
Just passed 800,000 followers which is lovely. I only joined Twitter because someone was pretending to me. Anyway, I’m very glad I did join. Thank you for all the jokes and all the kindness. It is easy to forget sometimes, that we are surrounded by some very wonderful people.
I hate this 2am hour.  All my works done, I’ve played every video game known to man. Seen everything on Hbo , Netflix & Showtime twice . Seen every YouTube video ever made   & Twitter hella boring At 2am.

Twitter, PLEASE make it possible for me to occasionally reply to a stranger’s tweet without algorithmically pushing the entire conversation to my unsuspecting followers’ feeds. Not every little comment needs that kind of audience. @Twitter @TwitterSupport
Less than 24-hours before Trump visits El Paso in what should be an attempt to heal the city and unite the country, he attacks the former congressman who represented the area on Twitter.
Twitter Philanthropy is taking over the World!
I’m at the Chicago Cubs game with some of the nation’s best investors and bankers. I’m trying to pitch my deal (which helps fund more charitable donations), but ALL they want to talk about is Twitter Philanthropy! Our work is taking over the nation! True story! ❤️👍🇺🇸
Rep. Joaquin Castro tweeted the personal information of people who donated and support President Donald Trump.   This man is a member of Congress!  He should be banned from Twitter and censured by the House of Representatives for his actions.  Who agrees?
There has been way too much negativity on twitter lately so let’s try something different.  Tag someone in this tweet that you truly appreciate. It could be a friend, family member, artist, creator, it doesn’t matter.   Just use this to brighten up someone’s day :)
Doxing is against Twitter's terms of service (unless you're a liberal, of course, then you're allowed to flagrantly violate any policy you want)
Much justification that it’s ok to share people’s private details and call, harass and abuse... I’m entitled to let my children use my phone and I don’t expect through WhatsApp, text or calls for my family to be abused on a private number! Call me what you like on Twitter...
“HaHA, there is violence in CHICAGO, a city I will never reference for any other reason, ergo your concerns about white nationalism are null and void!” — the worst form of Twitter.
Tomorrow the BBC is doing a big info push on “No Deal” Brexit - or disorderly, to be more accurate. To keep them honest, I will be taking over the Best for Britain twitter feed, and scrutinising the claims that emerge.  Do follow @BestForBritain for a fun-filled, fact-packed day.
What astonishes me the most is that Twitter says these comments aren’t against their policies, but then turn around and ban a conservative for the same thing. Happens everyday.  These people have no problem lying to us, and leaving the room with a smile on their face.
Trump has attacked Strzok on Twitter nearly two-dozen times since January 2018. Strzok notes that in his lawsuit, arguing FBI was pressured by Trump to fire him over texts—but never seriously investigated anti-Clinton agents who leaked to the Trump campaign in runup to election.
I ain’t gon say no names but one of the greatest rappers of all time trending on the twitter .
"Don't get political." Why are you even on Twitter then? Get your fragile ass outta here.  "I watch you to escape politics." I've always discussed politics, I only hear from your weak ass when you disagree with me.  First amendment bitch, love it or leave it, remember? 🗽
Not gonna lie, getting a thank you from Barack Obama on twitter is not a bad way to start the day.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and liberal Twitter personalities are trying to dox some underage kids for taking a photo with a cutout at the Fancy Farm political picnic and are cheering on thousands of accounts calling for Senator McConnell to 'break his neck.’
And some people on it one too 🤨
The day a twitter mob can change a headline on the New York Times this paper is truly finished and replaced by a new kind of 1984 Ministry of Truth. The news is now what people say it is.
Stop telling me that the president* is "different" on Twitter and in other contexts. He's the same guy.
Imagine a service where you could find people most in need, and help them directly.  Now make it free.  Now realize that’s what Twitter can be.  Manage your feed appropriately and you have a more powerful resource to help people than many of our nation’s charities.
I am tired of people who thank God for blessings on Twitter & other social networks, God doesn’t follow you on twitter. Close your eyes and thank him, he is not online.
Dear Twitter Friends   As a Special Olympics Athletes   My weight loss progress   I lost 24 pound ❤️
Everyone has personal politics. Not all mass shootings are politically motivated. (Most are domestic violence.) It’s beyond irresponsible to use the Dayton shooter’s lefty Twitter to assign a political motive. The far right would like to equate Dayton to El Paso. Don’t let them.
Gary Linekar has got to be one of the most professional, inoffensive, laid-back football hosts in television, but because he tweets his political opinions, which differ to some of those on Twitter, he’s “ruined MOTD”.   He’s been on it 20 years mate.
Anyways I gotta stay off twitter till I watch the euphoria finale but I been so damn busy. bye see u soon
stages of Feral Hog Twitter  1. confusion seeing everyone tweet “30 to 50 feral hogs”  2. find the tweet & assume it’s satire 3. read the tweet again & realize it’s for real 4. like and RT only feral hog tweets for 12 hrs straight 5. become 30 to 50 feral hogs
A Twitter account that appears to belong to Dayton shooter Connor Betts re-tweeted extreme left-wing and anti-police posts as well as tweets supporting the violent protest group Antifa, CNN reports.
I woke up this morning to another person on 4chan describing their plans to come kill me and my colleagues at work. Unbelievable that either of these hate sites are even allowed on Twitter. #untwitter8chan
#untwitter8chan because @jack @twitter should not be giving Nazis and white supremacists a platform.   Keep it trending. Spread the word.
An account with 400 followers saying joe budden is #3 rapper of all time was enough to dominate the entire conversation on twitter for a day
Get in loser we’re breaking zack fox out of twitter jail
i come on twitter and see zach is trending for cheating and i got as hell.. like who tf did i cheat on?!?
Every Tweet signed off with "I miss Yoongi"
The Dayton shooter who killed 9 people is a far-left terrorist.  He was active on twitter where he promoted:  - Antifa - Socialism - Communism - Anti-borders - Anti-ICE - Satanism  Why am I barely hearing anything about this on the media here in Europe🤔
we knew years ago that white supremacicsts were targeting young white men on reddit, 4chan, 8chan, twitter, etc. we talked about it but were shouted down by leaders of those companies who thought their idea of “free speech” was more important than the threat.
I will try to use Twitter again
I can't be the only writer who scrolls through Twitter when I need a name for a minor character. So, um, if you see your name pop up in a project of mine, I clearly like your name 😂
Hey twitter world.

There's good news and bad news.   The bad news is, we're destroying the planet.   The good news is, people aren't as awful in real life as they seem on Twitter.   You're still thinking about the bad news aren't you.
Trump says provide FBI everything they need to stop domestic terrorism- 1st thing FBI needs from President - President to stop inciting division in America based on race and religion, 2nd thing FBI needs - President to stop attacking the FBI in public & Twitter with baseless lies

Neil deGrasse Tyson needs to politely excuse himself from twitter, when we decide we want cinemasins but for real-world tragedies I promise we'll go to him
Can’t believe vulture twitter these people expressing a sick glee baying for genocide in Kashmir. Ranting about “final solutions”. This is the Modi voter
I forgot how disgusting Post-Mass Shooter Twitter is.
You’re a scientist, you understand false equivalency, yeah? How many of those things you listed are done with purposeful, malicious intent? Quit being Edgelord, Ph.D on Twitter.
Millie, don’t take this the wrong way, but you are literally the dumbest human being on Twitter today. And I fought with a guy who had an 1987 Toyota Celica as an avatar.  So go fuck yourself.
I’ve seen a lot of “can’t we just come together & solve this problem” in my twitter feed. Sorry, but this ain’t a “two sides”/“too much polarization” issue. It’s a matter of bad faith & corruption on ONE SIDE. The sooner we recognize that, the sooner we can begin to solve this.
Take down your Twitter account and resign!
I don't wanna see ANY Black Twitter frauds who spent the last 5 years calling Black men toxic trash to open your hypocrite traps to condemn white supremacy now that your editor zaddys are doing it. STFU. Y'all use anti-Black rhetoric too & I'm in a receipt pulling mood.
Lot of vultures on Twitter, without even the basic sense of empathy. The glee they display via their tweets is so sickening. #Kashmir
Today is the first day in my over ten years of Twitter that people actually appreciated my swearing and I can honestly say most of my DMs were positive.  I thank you all.  And fuck those GOP assholes.
Tendency on Twitter for those of us not in Kashmir to amplify and stir the sense of foreboding in the absence of information. Helps nobody to add to the already ominous overhang. We should see this as something that involves us all and affects us all. Whatever it is, stay calm 🇮🇳
Twitter locked my account for 3 days this week for a tweet that said, “the number one terrorist threat in America remains white supremacist males.”  July 23, FBI Dir Christopher Ray testified the same before Congress.  Today, #DaytonaShooting, 9 killed by a white supremacist.
Football is back...which means the 👑 of Twitter is back 😁
Zack Fox twitter account got suspended.  Now I've got depression.

There is something else Trump — or his aides — did last night to whitewash Twitter criticism.  After he tweeted his later tweets — 2 — re:  the “hateful act’ & how he & Melania send prayers, blah, (which itself showed they were scared, since he’d already responded), there was...
Two mass shootings in less than 24 hours.  Republicans in Congress do NOTHING.  Donald Trump incites violence on twitter and at his rallies.   #VoteThemOut
I get that it's a bad idea to republish the El Paso shooter's manifesto because you are spreading his propaganda.  But I think it's also a bad idea to ignore that much of his manifesto is ripped directly from Trump's Twitter feed
this is why we leave twitter. cos i'm tired of you people lol. i love you, but i'm tired.
Donald Trump needs to give a speech to the nation tonight. He needs to call out white supremacist terrorism by name. He needs to take a break from Twitter trolling for several days at least. We need unifying, determined, presidential leadership from him.
Wow.   He told police he “wanted to kill as many Mexicans as possible”  Remind me why you still allow @realdonaldtrump on this platform @jack @twitter because I’m pretty sure if someone murdered 20 people after I’d whipped them up, my account would be long gone.
The Finance Minister is trying to fix the economy by taking ideas from Twitter trolls.  That sounds like a continuation of the policy so far 👏🏼
Twitter is so ugly and out of line tonight on so many levels. I’m out.
Sir, I go to synagogue to pray, not to your Twitter feed. We expect you as Senate Majority Leader to use the power the American people have put in your hands “to support and defend the Constitution” (Not Putin & the NRA) “against all enemies, foreign and domestic.”
El Paso mass shooter heavily influenced by Christchurch mass shooter so the Twitter media brain trust trends his name. Great work team.
Wow 600,000 friends on Twitter up from only 50,000 at the beginning of 2019.  It only matters if we do something with it #YangGang 🥊👍🇺🇸
It never ceases to amaze me that when I talk about hate crimes, I get hit on twitter by people saying I blamed President Trump or Fox News.  Those words never came out of my mouth. Not once in 4 hours straight on air.  It's such a self-own.  @CNN
The #ElPaso shooter wrote a manifesto that talked about his hatred for Hispanics. So when you ask “where was he radicalized”, look no further than the words coming out of the mouth (and cesspool of a twitter feed) of the current occupant of the White House.
Uniters we need your help! We got nominated for 2 categories at MEUS PRÊMIOS NICK 2019 🙆🏼‍♀️  Comment #MPN #Uniters #NowUnited on this post and I’ll stalk some of you on Twitter 😏🤭 (but don’t use numbers or emojis)!! Let’s make this happen.. I wanna come back to Brazil🙊🥳
when is someone gonna finally do something about the amount of shootings happening in the USA?! i feel like i see a new headline every time i open up twitter. so so so infuriating.
Chairman All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) Syed Ali Geelani took to Twitter to urge the Muslims across the globe to help “save our souls” from “the biggest genocide” India is about to launch in occupied Kashmir.   #ARYNews
Before Twitter, it was really inefficient  and socially awkward to find strangers and inform them why you think they’re misinformed, stupid, and worthless.
people who make fun of twitter users with pronouns in their bio have bio's that either look like  "god must've craved chaos when he made me... that is, if god even exists (which he does not)"  or  "Bestselling author. Formerly WSJ. Formerly The Atlantic. Currently unemployed."
My twitter feed today is filled with videos of Russian police arresting peaceful citizens, usually just standing quietly (with a flag sometimes), not even protesting. These are not images of a strong, legitimate, respected government. Putin's paranoia is growing.
Shouldnt #PM Imran’s office and twitter be active on the explosive situation in occupied #Kashmir/LoC? Or does he only want to tweet to congratulate Modi and Kohli? Does he even know whats happening? Is he waiting to be told to speak?
My Twitter bio literally says "Law Grad" so pretty much nobody else who read that tweet thought I was implying I'd never been to university and would infer I was referring to the young people I was with.  We may have been to the same school, but at least they taught me to read...
#DevinNunesIsAFakeFarmer is the last thing Twitter needs to trend today.   It’s juvenile and not funny at all.   Please don’t encourage #DevinNunesIsAFakeFarmer to trend today.
Why is it that many of the biggest and most vile trolls on Twitter have bios that include phrases like “God loving” “Devout Christian” “Loves Jesus” and “Deeply Religious”?  How does one square that exactly? #Hypocrisy
How does Nirmala Seetharaman plan to save the Indian economy from an impending collapse? She meets a BJP Twitter troll for feedback, of course. This is a government for Twitter trolls, of Twitter trolls and by Twitter trolls.
